PAL  A damper for use in submerged hydrophone suspension systems including an
      elongated mass cylinder defined by a tube of flexible synthetic plastic
      film utilizing a check valve located at each end permitting water to enter
      the tube and preventing egress. Additionally, each tube end is provided
      with a disk transversely disposed to the tube length and of a diameter
      substantially greater than that of the tube to provide drag and
      hydrodynamic mass damping. The tube and disk are of a configuration to
      eliminate vortex shedding and the entire damper assembly is capable of
      being folded and packed within a concise configuration prior to
      deployment.

PAL  A flexible longitudinally continuous tape construction is disclosed for use
      in joining mating edges of juxtaposed members, the tape having an X-like
      configuration transversely of its length to provide legs adapted to
      receive and be secured to the edges of the members to be joined. The tape
      is capable of serving as a pliable hinge to permit articulation of the
      joined members, or it may also serve simply as a binding for joining
      members intended to be fixed relative to each other. The tape construction
      combines longitudinally continuous marginal web portions or carriers,
      forming the extremities of the legs of the X, with longitudinally spaced
      strand or equivalent connector means running crosswise of and
      interconnecting pairs of marginal web portions. The connector means
      intersect and interlock forming the axis of the X-like configuration.

PAL  The method of packaging perishable products in a container and insuring
      preservation of the products while in the container, which method consists
      in permanently sealing the opening of the container after the product is
      packaged thereafter forcing an inert fluid to expel the air from the
      container through a port entry and exhaust, then sealing the port entry
      and exhaust while in the process of purging, thus trapping the inert fluid
      in the container.

PAL  A lock for a height-adjustable crib or playpen requires two distinct manual
      operations in order to release the lock on each crib leg. Each lock
      includes a rigid metal bracket which engages around the extensible part of
      the leg and is pivotally connected to a crib corner post. The bracket has
      a nose which projects into one of a series of openings in the extensible
      part of the leg then the bracket is swung against the leg part to prevent
      movement of the leg part relative to the post. The upper edge of the
      bracket is slotted to receive a latch pivotally connected to the corner
      post just above the bracket. The latch drops into the slot when the nose
      is engaged in one of the openings so that the bracket cannot be moved.

      transverse to the longitudinal axis. The container has a structure
      effective to receive both liquids and gas mediums therein and has valves
      for introducing and exhausting both liquid and gas mediums. An elongated
      frame structure has a plurality of parallel linear support members wherein
      each support member is laterally spaced with respect to any other lateral
      support member, and a separate end frame portion connected at each end of
      the support members to form an open structural configuration for receiving
      the collapsible container. The elongated container is fastened to the
      frame structure with the longitudinal axis thereof disposed substantially
      parallel to the linear support members and each of the end surfaces of the
      container being disposed adjacent an end frame portion to support the
      container within the frame structure during use. The container is attached
      to the frame structure with one of the linear support members extending
      longitudinally along one side of the container with the opposing side of
      the container being free of a support member. The assembly may be used as
      a pontoon when the container is inflated with a gas fluid medium and is
      employable in other uses such as a fresh water reservoir, a ballast, a sea
      anchor, a pitch and roll stabilizer and the like when the container is not
      inflated or holdls a liquid fluid medium.

PAL  A novel slipper and its method of fabrication is described. The slipper
      comprises a substantially flat sole member with die-cut bounding edges
      onto which is heat-sealed an overlying arc-shaped vamp. The novel method
      is characterized by pre-tacking vamps at predetermined locations to a sole
      web, and substantially simultaneously heat-sealing each vamp to a sole and
      die-cutting the bonded sole and vamp from the sole web.

PAL  An automobile conveyor for use in conjunction with a wheel spinning device
      for an automatic wheel washer including an endless chain having a
      plurality of selectively engageable dogs pivotally secured thereto. The
      dogs normally travel in a position to urge an auto through the washer
      whereat the outboard end is in close association with the chain and
      beneath the automobile first supporting surface. Operating means are
      included whereby when an automobile is in position at least one of the
      dogs will be automatically moved to a position where the dog extends above
      the automobile supporting surface, contacts a wheel, and urges the car
      through the washer apparatus. At the wheel spinning and washing station
      the chain is forced downwardly to a position whereat it passes beneath the
      mechanism necessary to perform the wheel spinning operation while still
      retaining the outboard end of the dog above the automobile supporting
      surface. The continual contact by the dog assures that the automobile
      moves through the washer apparatus in a continuous motion.

      A diaphragm is structured within the bottle insert to provide either a
      cylindrical or a noncylindrical wipe over the particular type of
      applicator tip selected for use in the product container. Furthermore,
      provisions are incorporated within the bottle insert to block passage
      through the wiping diaphragm of misaligned comb type applicator tips and

PAL  A floor cleaning machine constructed as a carriage equipped with a pole and
      having at least one motor-driven cleaning implement or tool rotating about
      a vertical axis and for wet cleaning the floor or the like. From a fresh
      water supply per unit of time there flows-out a regulatable quantity of
      fresh water to which there is added a cleaning agent, this mixture
      flowing-out at the region of the cleaning implement or tool. The machine
      works the floor or the like with the fresh water-cleaning agent mixture by
      means of the cleaning implement and the thus resulting soiled water is
      sucked-up from the floor and collected in a separate soiled water
      container. The fresh water container which supplies the fresh water is
      formed by part of the machine housing body, whereas the soiled water
      container is constituted by a separate, portable container which when
      assuming its working position is enclosed in the machine housing. This
      soiled water container is connected via a seal to the suction compartment
      of a suction blower and is protected from over filling by means of an
      automatically operating level limiting device. Further, means are provided
      to ensure that the water of the mixture of air and soiled water which
      enters the machine does not contact the suction blower and also prevent
      the splashing water of the soiled water container which may splash around
      during movement of the machine from entering the suction blower.

PAL  In the handling of bundled articles, for example, logs and timber, it has
      been known to use a large variety of knots and tethering devices with what
      are known in the logging industry as toggles. Prior known techniques and
      devices have caused excessive wear on ropes and have been time consuming
      in forming attachments, particularly in log booms. The present invention
      provides a one piece toggle having a plurality of rope receiving holes
      therein and contoured to permit rapid threading of ropes for cables and
      reducing wear on the ropes or cables to a minimum.

PAL  For releasably interconnecting a first member and a second member such as,
      for example, a neck band or strap having a depending chain or the like and
      a musical instrument such as a saxophone there is provided a coupling
      device comprising a housing to which the chain is connected, opposed
      closure members being mounted within the housing with adjacent end
      portions of the closure members being resiliently urged by the inherent
      resiliency of the closure members towards a closed condition in which the
      saxophone is connectible thereto. A manually operable actuating member is
      mounted on the housing and is movable between a first position in which a
      portion of the actuating member which is of frusto-conical form, permits
      the adjacent end portions of the closure members to attain the closed
      condition, and a second position in which the frusto-conical portion of
      the actuating member urges the closure members to an open condition of the
      above-mentioned adjacent end portions thereof against the influence of the
      resilient urging of the closure members.

      transversely supported blades are supported in a holder in which they are
      individually yieldable to the passage of enlargements in the yarn and the
      longitudinally supported bar is supported on an eccentric for pivotal
      movement about an axis parallel to the transverse blades and for
      adjustment toward or from the transverse blades to adjust the width of the
      yarn passage. A tension lever is mounted on the upper end of the bar above
      the pivot axis for biasing the bar relative to the blades.

      tubular roller-threading device by a fluid stream applied at a single or
      axially spaced points into the tube. The longitudinal slot of the tube
      allows the fluid-conveyed filament to be drawn out of the tube when the
      filament is placed in tension, e.g., after it has been fed around the
      respective rollers, and processing thereof is ready to begin.

PAL  Burnishing tools are constructed for operating on internal and external
      cylindrical surfaces of substantial length to produce a compacted finished
      surface thereon. The burnishing tool has a mandrel with a truncated
      conical surface on which truncated conical rollers rotate as the tool is
      driven in rotation relative to the workpiece. By axially moving the
      mandrel and cage relative to each other the contraction and expansion of
      the rollers occurs. The rollers are retracted when the workpiece is to be
      removed therefrom or applied thereto and are expanded under a
      predetermined pressure into engagement with the workpiece for producing
      the burnishing operation under substantial pressure. The machine herein
      illustrated is self-contained having a pulley driven in rotation by an
      adjacently supported motor for rotating the burnishing tool while
      permitting the expansion and retraction of the rollers.

PAL  The invention is directed to a method of and machine for loading a scroll
      of film and take-up spool into a cartridge and assembling and sealing the
      cartridge. It includes the steps of supplying a web of film and backing
      paper to a scrolling mechanism and winding the webs into a scroll. A
      single guide track guides and assists in advancing the webs of film and
      backing paper to a winding spindle. Severing mechanisms are located along
      the guide track to cut the webs into the desired lengths. The winding
      spindle is engaged by the webs for scrolling within a socket on a first
      transport carrier. When scrolling is complete the spindle is withdrawn and
      the scroll is retained in the socket. An ultrasonic securing device is
      used to secure a free end of the scroll to a take-up spool carried in
      another socket of the carrier. A transfer mechanism then transfers the
      spool and scroll from the first carrier into the chambers of a waiting
      cartridge bottom carried on a further transport carrier device which
      transports the loaded cartridge bottom to a station where the cartridge
      cover is placed on the bottom portion. An ultrasonic welding mechanism
      then seals the cover to the bottom completing the cartridge.

PAL  A fastener feed assembly for a tool such as a power screwdriver having a
      drive member such as a rotatable bit includes a base fixed to the tool and
      a nose assembly slidably related to the base. The nose assembly includes a
      workpiece engaging surface, and when the tool is moved toward the
      workpiece during a fastener driving operation, the base moves toward the
      nose assembly. A return spring separates the base and nose assembly when
      the tool is withdrawn away from the workpiece. A strip of fasteners is fed
      from a magazine along a feed path through the nose assembly with
      sequential fasteners located in a drive position. Normally the drive
      member is spaced from a fastener in the drive position. During movement of
      the tool toward the workpiece in a driving operation, the drive member
      moves into engagement with a fastener in the drive position, and then
      continues to move in order to drive the fastener into the workpiece. A
      pawl is engageable with the strip in order to advance the strip along the
      feed path. During the driving operation, a feed mechanism operates in
      response to movement of the base toward the nose assembly to cock the pawl
      by moving it away from its home position along the strip away from the
      drive position. A lost motion arrangement delays cocking of the pawl until
      after secure engagement of the drive member with a fastener in the drive
      position. In response to withdrawal of the tool from the workpiece, the
      feed mechanism returns the pawl to its home position to feed an adjacent
      fastener of the strip to the drive position. Feed movement of the pawl is
      delayed until withdrawal of the drive member from the strip feed path. The
      strip includes a carrier with structure deformed during the drive
      operation for preventing reverse movement of the strip during cocking of
      the pawl.

PAL  The method of forming a tube fitting assembly is disclosed in a fitting
      having a first bore through a portion of the fitting and a second bore
      larger than the first bore and concentric with and through a portion of
      the first bore. A tubing having a diameter substantially equal to the
      first bore is engaged against an inside surface of the fitting defined by
      the end of the first bore. Relative movement between the fitting and the
      tube deforms the tubing wall to engage the first and second bores and to
      form an annular bead of the tubing wall outside of the fitting assembly.
      The bead is swaged into engagement with an outside surface of the fitting
      surrounding the second bore. The foregoing is merely a resume of one
      general application, is not a complete discussion of all principles of
      operation or applications, and is not to be construed as a limitation on
      the scope of the claimed subject matter.

PAL  A manufacturing method of thermoelectric modules having slight internal
      resistance comprising very thin plates of P type and of N type stacked
      alternately and connection bridges between each plate of P type and the
      neighbouring plates of N type. The method is characterized in that after
      cutting out of the plates of P and N type an alternate sequence of plates
      of P type and of N type is formed by assembling plates, and by inserting,
      between two plates, insulating sheets every other one of which extends
      beyond the upper face of the assembly, the others extending beyond the
      lower face and then by immersion of the lower and upper faces in brazing
      material.

PAL  Supplementary metallized connection parts short-circuiting or connecting
      incremental sub-components of one or more circuit elements of an
      integrated circuit are laid down on the semiconductor slice at the same
      time as the usual metallized connection pattern is made. The components
      associated with the incremental sub-components are measured to determine
      the program of adjustment and selective burnout of the supplementary
      connections. The selective burnout is carried out by applying a sequence
      of pulses to the segments to be burned out under monitoring by a measuring
      circuit, which blocks the delivery of further pulses, either immediately
      or after one or a few more pulses, when the measuring circuit detects the
      opening of the connection. The process is preferably carried out on
      integrated circuits before the semiconductor slice on which they are made
      is separated into individual circuit units. The pulses are applied in
      sequences in which individual pulses or series of pulses have increasing
      amplitude and/or pulse duration and/or pulse frequency.

PAL  The method and apparatus includes the use of at least one pallet, an
      assembly line, a projector means, and an electrical testing means.
      Assembly of the wiring harnesses takes place on the pallets which are
      either independently powered or move on a powered conveyor line. In either
      alternative, the pallets move along a non-synchronous, power and free
      assembly line. An overhead projector means is provided above selected work
      stations to project instructions and diagrams on the pallet. Electrical
      testing means are used to test the wiring harnesses during assembly, prior
      to completion of assembly, and to control movement of the pallet to the
      next work station. The method includes testing partially assembled
      components for electrical opens, shorts and incorrectly assembled
      components on the pallet at intermediate stages of assembly and passing
      the partially assembled components to the next stage of assembly only when
      the components have been shown to be correctly assembled.

PAL  The invention concerns connectors having an elongate spring body of
      elastomer or formed as a tubular spring about which a single layer wire
      coil is wound. The coil turns are separated by cutting the coil
      longitudinally of the body to define discrete conductive paths of C-shape
      extending round part of the circumferential profile of the body. Exposed
      surface portions of the wires present contact points in a row along the
      body. Each C-shaped turn may present a pair of diametrically opposite
      contacts. The coil may be wound about a former disposed beside the spring
      body so that on cutting the turn portions at the former leads to the
      individual C-shaped turn portions extend freely from the spring body.

PAL  The knife has a slotted handle and a blade that pivots into and out of the
      slot of the handle. A free floating pivot pin extends through the slotted
      end of the handle and through the opening of the tang of the blade, and a
      slotted ring lock extends about the pivot pin. The ring lock is rotatable
      on the handle so that its slot is movable into and out of alignment with
      the slot of the handle, to lock the blade with respect to the handle. The
      periphery of the tang defines hemispherical indentations, and a
      spring-urged ball in the handle engages the tang and registers with the
      indentations so that the blade resists movement when in its folded or
      extended positions but is free to move when intermediate the end
      positions.

PAL  A portable power tool having an annular ring tool, such as a saw blade or
      grinding wheel, driven on its periphery by a power unit. A ring tool
      housing carries the ring tool and is mounted to the power unit, the latter
      having a drive shaft roller which frictionally engages one surface of the
      ring tool. Ring tool guide bearings and ring tool support bearings oppose
      and cooperate with the drive roller to retain the ring tool within the
      housing during its rotation.
PAL  The driven shaft axis is canted at an angle extending beyond the center of
      the ring tool or toward the working side of the ring tool to counteract
      the torque forces produced by the working operation. Means are also
      provided to vary the drive roller pressure on the ring tool to balance the
      torque or, alternatively, to vary the drive shaft axis angle to balance
      the torque thereby producing dynamic stability during the working
      operation regardless of work piece resistance.

PAL  A dental articulator comprises a pair of upper and lower brackets for upper
      and lower artificial dentures, respectively, with a support between the
      two brackets. The upper bracket is pivotally interconnected to the support
      for vertical swinging movement of the upper bracket relative to the
      occlusal plane of the articulator. The support and the lower bracket are
      slidably interconnected for relative movement in a forward and rearward
      direction parallel to the occlusal plane and perpendicular to the axis of
      vertical swinging of the upper bracket. The support and lower bracket can
      also have limited relative rotational movement in a plane parallel to the
      occlusal plane. A plate is insertable and removable in the articulator in
      inverted positions, so that in one position the upper surface of the plate
      lies in the occlusal plane and in the inverted position the under surface
      of the plate lies in the occlusal plane.

PAL  A drafting machine in which parallel support rails moveably support a rule
      or straight edge extending perpendicularly therebetween so the rule is
      moveable in parallelism with itself. The rule has a replaceable graduated
      working edge and carries an endless band which is parallel to the working
      edge and which has groups of graduations distributed therealong which can
      be brought into selective registration with the graduations on the working
      edge. The graduations on the endless band form reducing scales. The rule
      is profiled and slidably receivable in the profiled rail is an auxiliary
      instrument which may, conveniently, have a part pivotally mounted thereon
      for movement in a plane parallel to the work area over which the rule is
      moveable. The auxiliary instrument is also tiltable away from the working
      area to expose the working edge of the rule.

PAL  The method of the invention includes the steps of positioning a support
      member having a substantially vertically extending recording surface
      thereon in the doorway for which the door is being sized, recording the
      contour of each side door jamb of the doorway on the recording surface by
      transposing the contour with a tracer mechanism having a follower adapted
      to be advanced along each side door jamb and a marker for recording on the
      surface information corresponding to the contour of the side door jamb,
      placing the recorded information in a cutting apparatus having means for
      controlling a cutter device in correspondence with the recorded
      information so that the cutter device is advanced along each side of the
      door member to cut the sides of the door to match the contours of the
      associated side door jambs. The apparatus of the invention consists of a
      vertically extending support member having a sheet of material extended
      vertically therealong, a centering assembly for positioning the support
      along the central vertical axis of the door opening, and a tracer
      mechanism movable along the support member and having followers adapted to
      engage the side door jambs whereby markers on the tracer mechanism will
      mark lines on the sheet of material as the tracer mechanism is advanced
      along the support member with the lines corresponding in contour to that
      of the associated side door jamb. The support member also includes
      adjustable means for comparing the head door jamb with horizontal.

PAL  A system including a highly accurate electronic navigator mounted on a
       vele and the method of using same. Azimuth or position data from the
      navigator is repeated by a gyro in a remote head on the vehicle slaved by
      torque and signal cables to the navigator. If the gyro torque cables are
      opened, the remote head may be removed from the vehicle and mounted on
      some other body. The azimuth or position data of the body can then easily
      be determined from the position of the remote head relative to the
      navigator references. In particular, the invention is envisioned as usable
      in laying missiles or guns with the navigator and remote head being
      carried by a jeep or the like.

PAL  This invention relates to a conveyor for transporting sheets of material
      through an ultraviolet exposing chamber for curing and setting of a coat.
      Up to this time, the drying of solvent ink has involved considerable
      pollution problems, a fair consumption of natural gas and large and costly
      ovens with high temperature incineration systems. These problems have
      generally been brought about by long ovens wherein the metal sheet has
      been passed through once or twice in order to accomplish curing or drying.

PAL  Apparatus for drying a travelling web, particularly a paper web. A hot air
      delivery structure is mounted adjacent the periphery of a steam heated
      cylinder to direct jets of hot air against travelling web supported on the
      cylinder. At least part of hot air delivery structure is moveable
      transversely of the cylinder periphery and the jets of hot air produce a
      surface effect to hold air delivery structure away from engagement with
      the web. Movement of hot air delivery structure is preferably achieved by
      flexure of that structure.

PAL  A game, primarily designed for preschool children, which includes a game
      board having a plurality of apertures located in the game board. Selected
      ones of the apertures have a first type of upstanding peg located within
      the aperture and the others of the apertures have a second type of
      upstanding peg within the aperture; the first pegs are longer, but the
      pegs and apertures are arranged to disguise the difference between the
      longer and shorter pegs. A card, or similar substrate, with questions on
      the top thereof can be disposed over the game board and this card or
      substrate will have a plurality of apertures therein capable of being
      aligned with certain of the apertures in the game board to provide
      multiple choice answers. A probe, or stylus, may be inserted in the
      apertures of the card and into the apertures of the game board. In the
      event that the player of the game inserts the stylus or probe into an
      aperture of the game board having the longer peg, the player will have
      selected an aperture corresponding to a correct answer. This peg of the
      first type is located to be inserted into the stylus to actuate a display
      member on the stylus such that the player of the game will recognize the
      selection of a proper answer in the multiple choice possibilities. In this
      way, visual and mechanical means are provided on the stylus or probe to
      indicate the correct answer. Moreover, the playing board is designed and
      the cards are designed with respect to the playing board so that a number
      of different cards with different questions and possibilities of answers
      are located at different positions on the cards.

PAL  A signboard construction including four frame members which support a
      plurality of signboard members capable of receiving indicia on either side
      thereof. The frame members and the signboard members are all formed from
      aluminum extrusions. Each of the signboard members has a principal
      vertically extending structure, an upper structure which forms a groove,
      and three pairs of mounting ribs, the lower two pairs of ribs being
      mounted on intermediate spaced apart portions of the principal structure
      and the upper pair of mounting ribs being mounted on the groove forming
      structure. The lower edge of one signboard member can be received within
      the groove forming structure of another signboard member and in this
      manner a plurality of signboard members can be assembled together. The
      ends of the top, bottom, and end frame members are cut at 45 degree angles
      and are secured to each other by corner angles. Each of the frame members
      includes an inner portion provided with a first channel of relatively
      large width capable of receiving a pair of mounting ribs and a second
      channel disposed in the middle of the first channel, the second channel
      having a relatively small width capable of receiving the lower edge of the
      principal structure of a signboard member. When the parts are assembled
      together the first channel of the top frame member receives the top pair
      of mounting ribs of the top signboard member, and the second channel of
      the bottom frame member receives the lower edge of the bottom signboard
      member.

PAL  An outrigger clip for use in releasably securing a fishing line to the
      run-out line on an outrigger pole, the clip being constructed to reduce or
      eliminate fouling of the fishing line. The body and clip release arm are
      constructed so that the clip, when in use, will have a tendency to hang
      from the outrigger line instead of twisting, which causes fouling of the
      fishing line. The clip body itself is smooth about the edges so that any
      contact with a fishing line caused by slack or the like will prevent or
      prohibit snagging or fouling of the fishing line about the clip body
      itself. The clip includes a fishing line release arm with an adjustable
      tensioning means and an outrigger attaching wire disposed through the clip
      body at such a position to place the center of gravity of the body away
      from the attaching wire and the outrigger line.

PAL  A long loop of tubular textile material stuffed with fiber, foam or a
      cotton rope passes through a cushion body, so as to form a handle at the
      top and dangling legs at the bottom. The bottom of the cushion is straight
      and the remainder of the edge is a curve from the summit of which the
      handle protrudes. Features of a face and hands are provided on the front
      of the cushion. A pocket on the back, open to the top, is large enough for
      inserting the end portion of the dangling legs, and thereby giving the toy
      an attractive rest position. The toy thus has some aspects of a fanciful
      stuffed animal type doll, a handbag and a cushion, but it is designed to
      induce its child possessor to use the dangling legs for practice in tying
      knots.

PAL  A toy helicopter rotor comprises a hub with rotor blades radiating
      therefrom. The hub comprises upper and lower hub parts having formations
      which releasably lock the parts together upon relative turning
      therebetween. Each blade has a root which is received in a complementary
      recess in the lower hub part and is trapped by the upper part, whereby the
      blades are secured to the hub. Projections on the blade roots retain the
      blades against radial, lateral and torsional movement and prevent them
      flying out of the hub in use.

PAL  A coupling member for a toy vehicle drive system that may be employed in
      various play situations. The coupling member is generally comprised of an
      exaggerated triangularly-shaped portion and a funnel-shaped portion. The
      exaggerated triangularly-shaped portion allows the toy vehicle to be
      driven forward and backward, and also allows it to complete a U-turn and
      to be disengaged from the drive chain of the drive system. The
      funnel-shaped portion ensures that the toy vehicle may be engaged by the
      driven chain when the child desires to drive the toy vehicle in its
      forward direction.

      dropping liquid from a plurality of locations to the bottom liquid
      receptacle, and the bottom liquid receptacle is positioned for and is
      capable of receiving the falling liquid so as to enable a multiple falls
      effect. At least one other receptacle is capable of supporting a hanging
      type plant. This plant receptacle is positioned above the bottom liquid
      receptacle, and the plant receptacle has a periphery which is different
      from the outside envelope of the falling liquid so that the hanging plant
      will not interfere with the falling liquid.

PAL  The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transferring
      yarn packages doffed from a textile machine provided with a conveyer belt
      disposed along the longitudinal direction thereof, to a container. The
      yarn packages are carried to one end of the conveyer and then dropped into
      the container positioned at a receiving position below and next to the end
      of the conveyer. The dropping distance from the end portion of the
      carrying surface of the conveyer to the surface for receiving yarn
      packages in the container is always maintained at a substantially
      predetermined distance which is larger than the width L of one package,
      but smaller than the width of two packages.

PAL  An apparatus for closing and sealing filled containers with a lid includes
      instrumentalities for positioning an individual lid beneath a sealing die
      which has an underside. The lid is temporarily held and finally joined to
      a container under the influence of heat and pressure. Suction is used to
      hold the lid against the underside of the die while it is being joined to
      the container. A plurality of protuberances are disposed at the underside
      of the sealing die. Each of the protuberances has an oblique surface. Each
      oblique surface has a point lying nearest a sealing surface defining an
      area of the underside, the area thus defined being substantially equal to
      that of the lid. Each lid can be consequently positioned correctly on a
      container and becomes fused therewith.

PAL  The device comprises at least one gatherer having two dividers and two
      advancing devices in the dividers for advancing severed stalks which have
      been severed by a cutting mechanism. Each advancing device comprises a
      front shaft and a rear shaft, the front shafts being parallel and upwardly
      and forwardly inclined and each carrying a rotary cutter adjacent the
      lower end of the shaft, a chain sprocket wheel and a rotary member fixed
      to the shaft adjacent the upper end of the shaft. An endless chain of each
      advancing device extends around the corresponding sprocket wheel. The
      rotary cutters are contained in the same plane and rotate in opposite
      directions. The rotary members co-operate with each other for seizing
      successive stalks before the stalks are severed and directing the stalks
      in a passageway defined by the dividers.

PAL  A method and apparatus for influencing the ambient or surrounding
      conditions during open-end spinning, wherein the fibers are delivered to a
      spinning rotor or turbine by means of a conveying air stream and then spun
      into a yarn in such spinning rotor. The invention contemplates cooling the
      spinning rotor by providing a simultaneously flowing stream of cooling air
      which is separate from the conveying air stream. The apparatus aspects of
      this development contemplate disposing the side of the spinning rotor not
      impinged by the fiber material-conveying air stream in a compartment
      having inflow- and outflow openings for the cooling air stream. The
      outflow opening is operatively connected in flow communication with an air
      conveying device.

PAL  A clock "friction" for use in clocks having plastic gear wheels which
      permits manual setting of the hands but in which a reliable level of
      frictional torque is obtained without requiring use of any auxiliary
      parts. The centerwheel of the clock has an interference fit with respect
      to the center, or minute hand, shaft upon which it is telescoped, and the
      minute hand shaft is formed with an annular groove lying generally in the
      plane of the centerwheel into which the plastic relaxes and flows for
      maintaining the centerwheel in a desired axial position. The minute hand
      shaft has a setting knob, and means are provided for precluding axial
      shifting of the center shaft, by pushing or pulling, which might result in
      stripping of the plastic in the groove.

      be disconnected from a neighbouring link to allow a unit to be added to or
      removed from the bracelet to alter its length. The unit consists of a link
      and a pivot element which is pivotally attached by one end to one end of
      the link and the other end of which has a pair of pivot projections for
      attachment to another link, e.g. of a similar unit. The said one link has
      at one end a pair of sockets facing opposite sides of the bracelet and
      these sockets have slots at their sides remote from said one end to enable
      the said pair of pivot projections on the pivot element of the unit to be
      engaged in and disengaged from the sockets. The said one link has a
      release member pivoted to it for movement into and out of a position in

PAL  A control system for a helicopter power plant with three power units
      driving the lifting rotor system through a main gearbox. Each power unit
      comprises a gas turbine engine of the gas-coupled type, a hydromechanical
      fuel control receiving electrical inputs to set a gas generator governor
      in the fuel control, an engine electronic control, and various engine
      accessories.
PAL  The operation of the power plant is normally controlled by the pilot
      through condition levers and switches on a control quadrant, through a
      pitch control by which the collective pitch of the rotor blades is
      controlled, and through a master beeper switch which is operable to trim
      the setting of an isochronous governor for the rotor system and the gas
      generator governors. The condition lever of each engine transmits a speed
      command signal through the electronic control of each power unit to its
      gas generator governor. A signal of collective pitch transmitted from the
      rotor control system to each engine electronic control is another factor
      in setting the governor.
PAL  The power plant includes a power management control, the principal function
      of which is to equalize the power outputs of the engines. It also includes
      the rotor isochronous governor. The power management control receives
      inputs of rotor system speed command and actual rotor speed and of the
      torques of the individual engines and transmits a governor trim signal to
      increase or decrease engine power to the several electronic controls.
PAL  All signals are transmitted electrically between the rotor system, control
      panel, power management control, and engine electronic controls. Excessive
      engine torque during rotor startup is avoided.

PAL  A combustion apparatus for gas turbine engines particularly adapted to
      reduce emissions to meet automotive requirements. The fuel is laid on the
      wall of a cylindrical prechamber and evaporated from the wall by
      combustion air which is introduced through a swirler at the upstream end
      of the prechamber. The inner surface of the prechamber is artificially
      roughened by a grid of grooves to improve fuel evaporation. The fuel is
      laid on the wall from an annular manifold extending around the upstream
      end of the prechamber through tangential orifices leading from the
      manifold into the interior of the prechamber. The fuel manifold is cooled
      and shielded from heat by an air jacket. More air enters through entrance
      ports distributed around the prechamber toward its downstream end. The
      resulting lean fuel-air mixture is delivered past an annular flow dam at
      the outlet of the prechamber into a combustion or reaction zone which is
      abruptly enlarged from the prechamber. The structure causes turbulent
      flow, recirculation, and good mixing in the reaction zone. A dilution zone
      downstream of the reaction zone has a circumferential array of dilution
      air ports which are of such shape as to be varied nonlinearly in area by a
      sliding ring valve. The sliding ring valve is coupled to a second sliding
      ring valve which varies the area of the air entrance ports in the
      prechamber in reverse sense to the dilution air ports. A pilot fuel nozzle
      to aid in cold starts is mounted at the upstream end of the prechamber.

PAL  A method and arrangement for preventing an underground manhole assembly
      from moving upwards in response to a change in soil conditions beneath the
      assembly are disclosed herein. For example, in the event the soil directly
      beneath the assembly includes substantial moisture and in the event this
      moisture freezes, the latter expands against the base of the assembly and
      in many cases pushes the assembly in an upward direction. The method and
      arrangement disclosed herein eliminates this upward movement by the
      utilization of a pressurized fluid barrier which is maintained between the
      manhole assembly and the soil directly beneath the assembly.

PAL  The invention concerns dynamic ballast and stabilization systems for
      deep-sea applications such as the dynamic anchoring and stabilizing of
      off-shore platform structures supported by an elongated structure of the
      type having the lower ends fastened into the floor of a body of water. The
      system employs a relatively large impellor assembly which generates a
      downward vertical thrust of sufficient magnitude as to maintain the
      platform anchored. The structure is designed to absorb shock and movement
      within a prescribed range to cushion and protect operating equipment. The
      impellor is enclosed in a movable slinger which can control the lateral
      direction of the impellor generated thrust such that lateral displacement
      of the structure is counteracted by the underwater reactive force
      generated by the impellor. This system includes means for converting the
      flow of seawater into usable power for driving the system.

PAL  A pair of diametrically opposed protuberances, comprising inwardly
      projecting bumps, extend from the otherwise smooth surface of opposite
      corners of adjoining side walls of the generally cubical pockets in an ice
      cube tray. These protruberances, define stress concentration areas at the
      corners of the frozen cubes which, when the plastic tray is twisted to
      release the cubes therefrom, cause the cubes to fracture and alter their
      configuration to the extent that they are prevented, either because of
      their enlarged outward dimensions or because of ice particles that have
      flaked therefrom and are in an interferring position, from being reseated
      in the tray in the as-molded position. Thus, each cube remains elevated
      from its original position with the side walls of each cube spaced
      somewhat from the side walls of the mold for relatively easy individual
      removal.

PAL  A universal coupling which is axially displaceable and angular movable, in
      which the torque is transmitted by three rolling parts evenly distributed
      about the circumference. The three rolling parts are connected to the
      inner part of the coupling in a rotatable and radially-movable manner. The
      three rolling parts also project into grooves. The displacement of the
      rolling parts required during an angular movement is carried out with the
      aid of a spring-derived force. The rolling parts, furthermore, have a
      cylindrical pin located in a radial bore of the inner part of the
      coupling, and the rolling parts are pushed radially outward by a force
      pushing on the inner end of the cylindrical pin.

PAL  A self-aligning shaft coupling in which an open coil, helical spring is
      carried by a flanged disc on a driven shaft for releasable coupling within
      a housing mounted on a driving shaft wherein the shaft may be in axial or
      offset misalignment. The housing has a cylindrical internal peripheral
      surface closed at its rearward end by a face having a plurality of axially
      extending radially spaced lugs integrally formed thereon, any one of said
      lugs providing the sole coupling spring driving means. The spring has
      identical end-turned portions each of which are square with the spring
      axis and terminate in inwardly directed radial tangs so as to engage a
      slot in the driven disc and one of the lugs of the driving housing
      respectively, to provide a flexible torsional shaft coupling that is
      readily separable.

PAL  A safety coupling which provides positive torque transfer and which
      disengages above a disengagement torque. The safety coupling comprises two
      coupling halves which are engaged to restrict axial movement. Some rollers
      restricted by a first coupling half are urged into recesses in a stop face
      associated with a second coupling half by a biasing mechanism enabling
      positive transfer of torque. However, disengagement of the coupling halves
      is permitted by a relative axial movement of the rollers and the stop face
      when the bias is overcome, the rollers being free to roll on fixed axes.

PAL  To permit selective needle projection, under control of a patterning
      arrangement, the needle jacks are made for rocking movement about an axis
      transverse to the direction of needle projection during knitting, and the
      camming system for the needle jacks is formed with two tracks, located one
      above the other (by a deeper cut, or camming elements of different
      heights) or, longitudinally staggered, one adjacent to the other, the cam
      tracks being arranged for selected projection of the needles to tuck or
      knit position; the needle jacks having either a butt projecting far enough
      to selectively engage either of the superimposed cam tracks, depending on
      the extent of rocking of the needle jack about the fulcrum, or the needle
      jack being formed with two butts, one on either side of the fulcrum, and
      selectively engaging the adjacent cam tracks, depending on the direction
      of rocking of the jack from a center position. The jack is retained in
      selected position with respect to the guide groove by a springy
      projection, laterally offset, and engaging a groove in the guide slot to
      prevent spurious rocking of the jack and escape from its controlled
      position. To control the needle jacks, selector jacks with respectively
      high and low break-out butts can be provided.

PAL  Compound knitting needles are operatively mounted in a circular knitting
      machine and coact with a special simplified cam system.
PAL  Each of the compound needles has a butt-free hook part and a latch. The
      latch has a first butt and is shiftable relative to the hook part and the
      hook part has an abutment which drives the tongue part. A lifting element
      is articulated to the hook part. The lifting element has a second butt and
      is radially movable by selecting members between an operative and
      inoperative position. When the lifting element is in the operative
      position it moves the hook part articulated thereto in accordance with the
      cam system of the circular knitting machine.

      second mouths together and a cam follower coacts with the movable mouth
      and engages with a cam to override the spring. The first mouth is in a
      form of a narrow aperture for defining a single yarn feed position for a

PAL  A machine is provided to straighten both the stem and the head of flanged
      stem workpieces such as poppet valves by rolling the stem of the workpiece
      between a rotary die and an arcuate stationary die. The flange of the
      workpiece being larger than the stem overlaps the rotary second die to
      have a first path of a contact portion of the flange. A straightening
      roller is journalled for orbiting movement on a rotary straightening
      member and the straightening roller has a contact area movable in a second
      path intersecting the first path to engage the flange and bend the
      workpiece cyclically. This bending effects a straightening of such flange.

PAL  An automatic combustion tester is disclosed. A burner is provided and is
      movable by a moving means between a first position adjacent a rigidly
      supported test piece and a second position. The burner is connected by a
      first conduit to a lateral tube which is, in turn, connected to a gas bomb
      by a coupling means. A flame timer is used for controlling the time during
      which a test piece is exposed to flames from the burner during a cycle. A
      down-time timer is provided for controlling the time during which the
      flame is removed from the test piece during a cycle. A heat shield is
      provided along with means for moving the heat shield between a position
      intermediate the test piece and the adjacent bunsen burner and a position
      removed therefrom. First and second microswitches are positioned to
      contact the conduit when the burner reaches its first and second
      positions. The first switch controls the heat shield and the second switch
      is coupled to a counter means for deactivating the system after a
      predetermined number of cycles of operation.
PAC  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
PAR  1. Field of the Invention
PAR  This invention relates to testers for determining combustibility of
      materials. More particularly, this invention relates to devices using an
      injection needle, etc., to periodically blow a fine flame onto a test
      piece for a definite period of time, with a predetermined non-exposure
      period between flame exposure periods. The operation is repeated to
      determine the number of cycles required until the test piece begins to
      burn, to determine whether the test piece catches fire after being
      subjected to the flame for a predetermined number of cycles, or to inspect
      combustibility by dividing the time of residual combustion after a number,
      e.g., five of successive cycles of, e.g., three seconds of flame exposure
      and, e.g., three seconds down time by the volume lost during the
      operation.
PAR  2. Description of the Prior Art
PAR  Various flame tests, particularly the last above-noted test, are conducted
      by hand. In this case, however, human error is unavoidable and results in
      very poor precision. For example, if the flame was successively applied
      five times for three seconds each time, i.e., a total of 15 seconds, the
      error accumulated through human inaccuracy may result in actual flame
      contact time of as little as 13 seconds or as long as 18 seconds.
PAR  The flame exposure period commences after the flame of the burner is
      brought into contact with the test piece. However, certain materials are
      easily affected or melted by the flame before it is actually brought to
      the predetermined position and wide variations in test results are
      obtained when testing these materials.
PAC  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
PAR  It is an object of the instant invention to provide a new and improved
      combustion testing system which minimizes error and is automated.
PAR  It is a further object of the subject invention to provide an improved
      combustion testing system that will produce accurate results even when
      easily combustible material is being tested.

PAL  A device for continuous temperature measurement of the dew point of flue
      gases, in which the signal of the sensitive unit, carrying information on
      the appearance of a condensate film on the condensation surface of the dew
      point temperature transmitter, is applied simultaneously to the regulator
      of the heating element and the regulator of the cooling element. Both of
      these are included in the condensation surface temperature control unit,
      wherein temperature control of the condensation surface is attained by the
      heating and cooling means operating simultaneously. The transmitter is
      provided with heating and cooling means.

PAL  Apparatus and method applicable to liquid chromatography for continuously
      detecting the viscosity of the effluent from an analysis column of a
      chromatograph system. The effluent is forced through a tubular path in a
      flow resistance element, which may contain a packing material to increase
      the amount of energy dissipated in the flow resistance element. The
      temperature of the effluent is sensed before and after passage through the
      path. A signal is generated which is a function of the difference between
      the value of temperature which is sensed before and after traversal of the
      effluent through the tubular path. From these measurements, the viscosity
      of the effluent may be computed as a function of the observed temperature
      change.

PAL  A system for testing opening-equipped containers for leakage during the
      entire period, which is usually relatively long, between the time that
      such containers are fabricated by the manufacturer thereof and the time
      that they are filled by the user with the product intended therefor. The
      system includes a testing method, a particular test closure or cap and
      structural relationship thereof with a container opening, and apparatus
      for establishing a pressure differential between the interior and exterior
      of any container under test. In the practice of such system, a pressure
      differential is established between the interior and exterior of the
      container, such as by vacuumizing the container interior; seating a
      closure cap of particular character against surfaces of the container in
      covering relation with the opening thereof, and sealingly relating the
      closure cap to the container and thereafter maintaining the sealing
      relationship therebetween using, in each instance, only the pressure
      differential as the seating and sealing force; transporting the sealed
      container from its place of fabrication to the place of use, either
      directly or with intermediate storage periods; and before the container is
      to be filled with a product, testing the tightness of the closure cap
      against the container as an index of the presence or loss of the pressure
      differential.

PAL  The detection of acoustic emissions emanating from an object is achieved
      with a capacitive transducer coupled to the object. The capacitive
      transducer is charged and then allowed to discharge with the rate of
      discharge being monitored. Oscillations in the rate of discharge about the
      normally exponential discharge curve for the capacitive transducer
      indicate the presence of acoustic emissions.

PAL  The invention relates to a device for measuring the quantity of a flow of
      fluid from fluid storage means such as liquefied gas. The device comprises
      a capacitor partially immersed in the stored fluid which includes a
      chamber being partially filled with the fluid. As fluid is drained from
      the capacitor, the timing and variations in capacitance are measured which
      is used to calculate quantity of flow.

PAL  A fitting is associated with a closed fluid system for allowing testing by
      means of a probe, meanwhile insuring the system is maintained in a closed
      condition. Such fitting has a resilient rubber member one side of which is
      exposed to the fluid in the system, and the other side of which is exposed
      to outside the system. The rubber member defines a passage from one side
      to the other which is held closed by the rubber member mounting means,
      which compress the rubber member to so close the passage. A testing probe
      may be pushed into and through this passage, to be exposed to the fluid in
      the system. The resilient member is in sealing contact with the probe when
      it is so introduced, and upon removal of the probe, the passage again
      closes, insuring that the system is continuously in a closed condition.

PAL  A flow restriction is placed in the pipeline through which the fluid to be
      sampled flows to provide a pressure drop that is proportional to the rate
      of flow of the fluid in the line. A sample bottle is connected to the line
      through a sample conduit that also contains a flow restriction to cause a
      pressure drop in the fluid flowing to the sample bottle. A variable flow
      restriction in the sample line downstream of the first flow restriction is
      adjusted to maintain the pressure drop across the flow restriction in the
      sample line proportional to the pressure drop across the flow restriction
      in the pipeline so that fluid flows into the sample bottle at a rate that
      is proportional to the rate of flow of fluid in the pipeline.

PAL  A power shift transmission having a fluid pressure control system having an
      intake screen and level control located centrally in the bottom of the
      sump and a pump and regulator valve supplying pressure to the shift
      control system and to a sump oil level control. The sump oil level control
      has a small float controlling a relay valve to control an oil level
      control valve connecting an elevated oil reservoir for gravity feed to
      fill the sump and pressure return to the reservoir to dump the sump. When
      the transmission input and pump is not driven, there is no pressure in the
      chambers at opposite ends of the differential land area level valve and
      balanced springs hold the level valve in a central closed position
      blocking flow to and from the reservoir, to the sump and from the pressure
      line so the oil level control is inoperative. When the transmission input
      is driven, a small flow of line pressure is supplied through an inlet
      restriction to each chamber. When the oil level is low, a miniature float
      provides a small force to close the miniature relay valve closing a
      restricted exhaust from the chamber at the larger area land so equal
      pressures in the chambers act on the differential land area to move the
      level valve to the fill position closing the supply pressure port and
      providing a full flow connection from the reservoir for gravity feed at a
      low volume rate of flow to the sump. When the oil level is high the float
      permits the pressure to open the relay valve and the restricted exhaust
      reduces the pressure in the larger area chamber to move the level valve to
      dump position closing the sump port and connecting a restricted supply
      pressure branch to the reservoir so the transmission pump delivers fluid
      at the same low volume rate of flow from the sump to the reservoir to
      reduce the oil level. In a modification a level indicating thermistor
      controls a solenoid controlled relay valve similarly controlling the oil
      level valve.

PAL  A self-loading limited slip differential is disclosed including at least
      two concentric layers of pairs of generally semi-spherical shells for
      applying friction torque bias to the driven shafts via the side and
      planetary gears of the differential gearing assembly. The shells of one
      layer are rotatably mounted on the planetary pinion shafts, respectively,
      and the shells of the other layer are non-rotatably connected with the
      driven shafts, respectively, said shells being compressed together as the
      side and planetary pinion gears are displaced apart upon the application
      of torque to the differential casing. In an alternate embodiment, in order
      to increase the friction torque bias, an additional pair of concentric
      layers of shell pairs are mounted concentrically upon the first two shell
      layers.

PAL  This invention relates to dies and the method for making dies for rolling
      threaded fasteners having conical or truncated conical ends. The face of
      each of a pair of dies which contacts the workpiece includes a first
      generally planar surface having a plurality of parallel ridges disposed
      thereon. A second generally planar surface having ridges thereon for
      threading the conical or truncated conical end is disposed on the face at
      an angle with respect to the first generally planar surface. The face on
      which the two generally planar surfaces are disposed is normally generally
      rectangular and elongated in the direction of relative movement between a
      pair of dies. The intersection of the two generally planar surfaces and
      each groove or ridge disposed on each such surface is positioned in
      parallel realtionship to every other ridge or groove and the intersection
      of the first and second generally planar surfaces. Each ridge disposed in
      a plane which is parallel to the first plane and the projection is
      disposed at an angle with respect to the direction of movement which is
      substantially equal to the helix angle of the threaded fastener to be
      formed. These angular relationships permit the rapid and inexpensive
      manufacture of dies for threaded fasteners of the type described by
      enabling cutting or grinding of the entire face with a multipoint cutting
      tool or a crushed grinding wheel in a single pass as opposed to prior art
      structures which necessitated the use of single point cutting tools or
      correspondingly shaped grinding wheels which machined or ground a single
      groove between adjacent ridges in each machining pass.

PAL  The system of this invention is for use with an electronic musical
      instrument having a keyboard, and generally includes keyboard circuitry,
      audio waveform generators, envelope generators, static and dynamic filter
      circuitry and power amplifier and speaker apparatus. In accordance with
      one feature of this invention, the system comprises means for establishing
      different digital voice codes which are coupled to read only memories
      associated with the audio waveform generators, envelope generators and
      main voice circuitry. This voice code provides a limited number of program
      conditions to control such variables as audio waveform pulse widths,
      envelope attack, decay, sustain or release intervals, and instrument
      resonator control. Another feature of the present invention is concerned
      with the keyboard circuitry which operates from a digital key and octave
      code. Each code is sequentially interrrogated to determine if the
      corresponding key has been played. Although the completely illustrated
      embodiment is of a monophonic system, this sequential interrogation scheme
      lends itself quite readily to polyphonic operation. Still another feature
      of the invention resides in a novel digital controlled oscillator of the
      audio waveform generators that includes a feedback control loop and
      wherein the majority of the components of the oscillator only operate over
      a one octave range.

PAL  This invention discloses a novel and improved mechanism for operating a
      bass drum which is totally adjustable. A telescoping rod and tube assembly
      is provided whereby the position and the height of the foot pedal may be
      adjusted to suit the operator's individual needs. The position of the
      mechanism may be arcuately adjusted about the drum head as well as the
      distance through which the beater ball moves to strike the drum head and
      the force required to be exerted on the depressible foot pedal to cause
      the beater ball to move. These various adjustments may be made singly or
      in concert.

PAL  The hydraulic controller is for controlling the operation of a plurality of
      hydraulically controlled devices. Hydraulic fluid may be selectively
      distributed by the controller to various controlled hydraulic devices in a
      timed and predetermined sequence. The timing of the distribution of
      hydraulic fluid by the controller can be quickly and easily varied by
      various control knobs on the controller to thereby vary the timed operated
      period of the various machine operations controlled by such devices
      without affecting the timed operation of other machine operations. The
      controller is supplied with a source of hydraulic fluid under a generally
      constant pressure. Cam means are associated with each of a plurality of
      fluid flow distributing valves for operating such associated valve members
      in a predetermined sequence of valve positions upon advancement of the cam
      means relative thereto. Drive means including a pair of opposed indexing
      and timing device pistons; advance the cam means relative to the valves to
      operate them in sequence of positions and in operating intervals or dwell
      periods thereof. The indexing piston has an effective working diameter in
      its cylinder which is greater than that of the timing piston such that it
      normally overrides the timing piston. The cam drive means includes lost
      motion means for allowing the cam means and associated distributing valves
      to dwell during timing strokes. Fluid flow restrictor means adjustably
      restrict the flow of fluid through the venting means to control the speed
      of the timing stroke and thereby provide an adjustable timed interval of
      operation of the device then being operated.

PAL  What follows is a description of a hydraulically powered actuator for
      producing a reciprocating output and a method which produces a
      reciprocating output in response to the controlled flow of a hydraulic
      fluid. The hydraulic actuator includes, in one embodiment, a cylinder
      within which a piston assembly is reciprocated, the cylinder being itself
      displaceably mounted within a housing so that it can periodically
      introduce a unique flow passage through which a rapid fluid flow occurs,
      the provision of the passage reduces the hydraulic power lost during
      reciprocating movement of the piston assembly and ensures a high energy
      output.

PAL  A servo device for steering gears for vehicles and ships is adapted to be
      coupled in a mechanical connection between said gear or the like and the
      steering rod or the like operated thereby. The device comprises a pair of
      opposed cylinder-and-piston units each having a working chamber, defined
      by the respective piston and adapted to be supplied pressurized fluid from
      a suitable source during control by valve means responsive to a movement
      of the output member of said gear and the resistance thereagainst of the
      steering rod operated thereby so as to amplify the power for overcoming
      said resistance by means of the pressure fluid in one of said pair of
      working chambers. The two pistons in the units are rigidly secured to each
      other and provided with an inlet passage for the pressure fluid to the
      working chambers and wherein the valve device of each of the units
      comprises a valve member, adapted normally to close a corresponding
      pressure fluid outlet from the working chamber to a return conduit to the
      pressure fluid source but to be actuated by movements of the output member
      of the gear under the intermediation of a transfer means for actuating in
      its turn a dampening element with a restricted fluid passage.

PAL  A display apparatus for facilitating adjustment of a printing press
      displays several quantities related to the inking of the printing press in
      a display that is arranged to show a functional relationship between the
      quantities. The settings of a plurality of ink adjustment devices are
      shown in a linear array of setting displays that are arranged in the same
      order as the adjustment devices are arranged across the width of the
      press. Each setting display comprises a column of equally-spaced dots with
      an interpolation dot at the end of the column. In vertical alignment with
      and in appropriate lateral relationship with that display of settings, a
      further display is provided showing deviations of the printed ink density
      from set points representing proper ink density. Each deviation display
      corresponds to a lateral portion of the press whose printed ink density is
      controlled by the settings of those of the adjustment devices with whose
      setting display it is aligned.

PAL  A portable, rocket-deployed signaling system for deploying a pin-point
       loion marker including a tractor rocket propulsion unit and attached
      payload container launched from a hand-held tube. The payload comprises an
      inflatable marker balloon, a gas generator for inflating the balloon and a
      tether line connecting the balloon to the launcher tube. A coupling pin,
      secured to the tether line at a predetermined length from the end attached
      to the launcher tube and removably supported on the payload container, is
      pulled subsequent to launch to permit the container to separate and deploy
      the balloon. A percussion igniter then actuates the gas generator to
      inflate the balloon with the generator separating after inflation.

PAL  A boat ride system for an amusement park, which includes a main channel and
      an auxiliary channel extending under the main channel and isolated from it
      except along a narrow slot. A boat for carrying people includes a hull
      floating in the main channel, a pair of paddles lying in the auxiliary
      channel, and a pair of supports extending through the slot and connecting
      the paddles to the hull. Pumps are utilized to pump water along the
      auxiliary channel so that the moving water pushes the paddles and
      therefore moves the hull along the main channel.

PAL  A combined speedometer and tachograph assembly has speedometer and
      tachograph indicia respectively arranged at one and the other side of a
      translucent plate and respectively adapted to be illuminated by separate
      light sources at opposite sides of said plate, the light transmission
      capability of the plate being such that the speedometer indicia when
      viewed from said one side of the plate are visible by the reflection from
      the indicia of artificial or natural light incident from said one side,
      but the tachograph indicia are only rendered clearly visible by the
      transmission through the plate of light incident on the tachograph indicia
      from an artificial light source at the other side of the plate.

PAL  An arrangement for securing a braided rope to the ski tow rope handle by
      passing the rope through a transverse hole in the handle, passing the rope
      around the periphery of the handle and then inserting a portion of the end
      of the rope into the braided rope so that it passes back through the
      transverse hole in the handle. The braided rope acts in the manner of the
      well known Chinese finger, in that the higher the stress placed on the
      rope, the tighter it grasps the end of the rope that is inserted into it
      to prevent its detachment from the handle. To insure that the braided rope
      always retains some grip on the portion of rope inserted into it and to
      provide protection for the hands of the skier, a rubber sleeve is placed
      over the rope directly adjacent to the handle. In order to prevent the
      rubber sleeve from being displaced, a length of heat shrinkable tubing is
      applied to the rubber tubing and extends beyond the tubing to overlap onto
      the braided rope itself. The inner surface of this heat shrinkable tubing
      is provided with a heat sensitive adhesive to increase its hold on the
      rubber sleeve and the braided rope.

PAL  An apparatus is provided which limits the amount of developer that is
      presented to an electrostatic latent image to a width corresponding to the
      length of copy paper used. This particular apparatus and method apply to a
      development system which has a developer sump communicated to a magnetic
      transport means through a developer outlet at the lower end of the sump.
      During development functions, magnetic developer flows from the sump
      through the outlet to the magnetic transport means to be presented to the
      latent image. A plurality of magnetic gates are provided, each of which;
      may be swung into closed position adjacent the outlet to magnetically
      block flow of developer through that portion of the outlet corresponding
      to the length of the magnetic gate adjacent thereto. Each magnetic gate
      may also be swung into an open position which allows developer to flow
      through the outlet corresponding to the length of the magnetic gate
      adjacent thereto. Certain of the magnetic gates may be selectively located
      in open or closed position to allow developer to flow through the outlet
      over a length corresponding to the length of a copy sheet being utilized.
      All of the gates may be located in closed position when it is desired to
      stop all of developer flow through the outlet to puurge the developer
      systems.

PAL  An internal combustion engine system, particularly as used for automotive
      vehicle propulsion, includes the engine with a muffler for reducing engine
      exhaust noise and fuelled by gas produced by a miniaturized gas reformer
      requiring heating and a supply of vaporized liquid hydrocarbon and
      oxygen-containing gas, the reformer usually being enclosed by a larger
      enclosure to form a space through which the engine exhaust is passed for
      supplying heat to the reformer, and having an exhaust heated
      heat-exchanger for its intake. By positioning the reformer inside of the
      engine's muffler so that the exhaust heat there is used to supply heat to
      the reformer, the need for the bulk-increasing larger enclosure is
      eliminated, and by arranging the intake heat-exchanger in the muffler so
      that the exhaust flow through the muffler is deflected both when entering
      and leaving the exchanger, a multi-deflected and therefore exhaust noise
      attenuation exhaust flow results.

      to improve the efficiency, performance and starting thereof, an optimum
      amount of electrical power being supplied to the heating means during
      operation of the engine. An important feature relates to the use of
      heating units mounted in an intake manifold preferably with there being
      one heating unit for each engine cylinder, mounted adjacent the intake
      valve. In an engine having fuel injection, a heating unit is mounted on
      the downstream side of each fuel injector. Another important feature
      relates to the provision of means controlled by ambient temperature
      sensing means for automatically adjusting the optimum amount of electrical
      power supplied to electric heating and vaporizing means.

PAL  An exhaust gas-detoxicating system for an externally ignited internal
      combustion engine having at least one air intake suction tube wherein a
      fuel/air mixture is produced by metering into said tube fuel from a fuel
      metering device, and wherein the fuel air mixture, before its entry into a
      cylinder of the engine, can be deviated through a heated-up bypass of at
      least one suction tube by means of a flap valve being disposed in said
      suction tube and being controllable in dependence on characteristic engine
      data, is improved by providing, in combination, measuring means for
      detecting the amount of air flowing through the said suction tube and
      means for controlling the flap valve in dependence on the detected air
      amount. Preferably, the measuring means comprise a Venturi constriction in
      the suction tube, a pneumatic-mechanical converter, and means actuating
      the converter in dependence on the pressure difference between the air
      pressure upstream, and the air pressure in the Venturi constriction at the
      narrowest cross sectional area of the latter.

PAL  In a fuel metering device for an externally ignited internal combustion
      engine with compression of the air-fuel mixture, which system comprises a
      suction tube for the intake of air in which an air-measuring device and a
      randomly adjustable throttle valve having a flap are arranged in sequence,

PAL  A fuel injection pump for an internal combustion engine wherein a plunger
      is mounted in a barrel for sliding axial movement and rotation about its
      own axis, and the barrel is formed therein with a suction port and an
      outlet port. A metering groove is formed in the plunger and maintained in
      communication with a top of the plunger through a bore formed in the
      plunger, so that a desired amount of metered fuel can be delivered to the
      engine according to the load applied to the engine by varying the area and
      the time at which the metering groove is brought into communication with
      the outlet port, thereby varying the amount of fuel outflow. A pulsation
      control chamber of a greater sectional area is formed in the fuel
      passageway between a discharge valve of the pump and a fuel valve so as to
      intensify and prolong the duration of throbs of a pulsating current of
      fuel moved through the pulsation control chamber as it is delivered by

PAL  A fuel injection system for an internal combustion engine in which the
      intake air flow is measured and a corresponding electrical signal is
      generated which governs a pressure control unit so as to modify the fluid
      pressure acting on a fuel-metering slide-valve piston, displacing it
      against restoring forces. The axial displacement of the slide-valve piston
      changes the flow aperture in adjacent metering slits and thus governs the
      rate of fuel flow to the injection valves of the internal combustion
      engine and maintains a desired fuel-air ratio.

      edge determining termination of fuel injection as the edges move past the
      fuel supply opening. In its improvement the piston is manufactured to
      provide a notch in its upper end surface which, at the intersection of the
      notch with the circumferential surface of the piston, forms at least two
      upper control sections serving at least as a part of the upper control
      edge. The two control edge sections have relatively different inclinations
      with respect to the upper end surface of the piston which effects the fuel
      injection.

PAL  Improved apparatus for supplying fuel to one or more fuel injectors used to
      inject fuel into a combustion engine. In the preferred form, each of the
      fuel injectors has its discharge port positioned in the engine intake
      manifold and a clamp retains the injector in position thereon. The clamp
      has a first portion that has a passage for receiving the inlet conduit to
      the fuel injector. Also, this portion of the clamp has inlet and outlet
      passages in communication with the passage receiving the injector inlet
      conduit so that fuel supplied to the inlet passage flows into the inlet
      conduit of the fuel injector and also flows out of the outlet passage. A
      second portion of the clamp is used for securing the clamp to the engine
      intake manifold. The fuel injector is located between the first portion of
      the clamp and the intake manifold. Flexible conduit may be used to connect
      the outlet passage of one clamp with the inlet passage to another clamp. A
      pressure regulator may be provided for regulating the pressure of the fuel
      flowing through the various clamps and flexible tubing.

      contained in said one end of the cylinder is displaced to the injection
      pump by applying fuel under pressure to the other end of the cylinder
      containing the shuttle from a further source of fuel under pressure. The
      pressure of the further source of fuel is higher than that of the first
      mentioned source.

PAL  An improved compressed fluid ball projecting machine convertable for
      baseball and tennis practice. Improvements are in maneuverability,
      oscillation of the tennis barrel and immobility of the baseball barrel,
      remote control power for coaching options, replaceable and interchangeable
      barrels, variable timer speed control and a reliable hopper and feed
      system to enable firing of up to two hundred tennis balls unattended and
      without malfunction. Regarding the oscillation or lack of oscillation of
      the barrel, an actuator rod mounted on a rotatable disc causes such
      oscillation. When this rod is removed and the barrel clamped, this
      oscillation is eliminated. Concerning the variable timer control, such
      control is varied by two relatively movable rotatable notched discs. These
      dics contact a valve actuating mechanism and permit opening of a valve
      operated thereby only when the notches of the pair of discs are aligned
      and in contact with the valve actuating mechanism.

PAL  Certain types of heat-exchangers have tubes opening through a tube sheet to
      a manifold having an access opening offset from alignment with the tube
      ends. A tool for inserting a device, such as for inspection or repair, is
      provided for use in such instances. The tool is formed by a flexible guide
      tube insertable through the access opening and having an inner end
      provided with a connector for connection with the opening of the tube in
      which the device is to be inserted, and an outer end which remains outside
      of the chamber, the guide tube having adequate length for this
      arrangement. A flexible transport hose for internally transporting the
      device slides inside of the guide tube. This hose is long enough to slide
      through the guide tube, into the heat-exchanger tube, and through the
      latter to the extent required for the use of the device. The guide tube
      must be bent to reach the end of the heat-exchanger tube and the latter
      may be constructed with a bend, the hose carrying anti-friction elements
      at interspaced locations along its length to make it possible for the hose
      to negotiate such bends while sliding to the location where the use of the
      device is required.

PAL  A heat exchange device installed in a fireplace without any modification
      thereto completely encircling the fire, sides, top, back and bottom but
      without having the heating tubes and ducts exposed to the destructive
      concentrated heat that occurs at the fire bed level of grate or andiron
      and including twin cold air ducts extending from front to rear of the
      fireplace at one lower corner thereof, twin hot air ducts extending from
      front to rear of the fireplace at the other lower corner thereof with the
      twin ducts interconnected by a plurality of heat exchange tubes which
      extend upwardly along the side walls of the fireplace and then
      horizontally in overlying relation to the fire in the fireplace an
      additional tubes extending horizontally across the bottom of the
      fireplace. A motor driven fan is provided in the bottom cold air duct to
      circulate air through the device. The twin ducts, having interconnecting
      apertures to the rear, include baffle arrangements to guide the flow of
      air through the heat exchange tubes for most efficient utilization of the
      heat from the fire in the fireplace. A forced draft device is incorporated
      into the cold air duct for selective discharge of air at the base of the
      fire in the fireplace to facilitate the initial burning of the fuel and to
      provide a forced draft for proper combustion of the fuel whenever desired.
      When the fire is first lit, the resulting flames hitting and passing in
      between and around the overhead heating tubes encircling the fire provide
      heat almost instantly and as the fire progressively burns, the entire
      length of the heating tubes, both overhead and encircling the fire on both
      sides and to the back, become heated providing a continuous expanded
      volume of hot air which is forced out into the room, away from the
      fireplace, this air is then circulated and again re-enters the cold air
      tubes by being forcibly drawn from the floor level and ejected as heated
      air on the opposite side of the fireplace. This results in an even room
      temperature, even at floor level. As the fire progressively burns, coals
      and ashes falling through the apertures in the conventional grate cover
      the heating tubes extending across the floor of the firepplace thereby
      extracting heat from this area of the fireplace which becomes heated last,
      but which also retains heat the longest, long after the fire itself has
      burned out.

PAL  The linear flow rate of a liquid containing dissolved oxygen, such as
      blood, can be determined by means of an electrode assembly having exposed
      to the liquid a relatively large polarographically active cathode and
      spaced therefrom a reference anode. With an applied energizing voltage of
      about 0.4-0.9 volts a current plateau is reached which is proportional to
      fluid flow rate. As the device is also sensitive to oxygen content,
      compensation can be measured by providing on the assembly an oxygen
      sensing membrane covered polarographic electrode pair of the Clark type.

PAL  A method and apparatus for automatically detecting the blood pressure of a
      person by auscultation in which a standard blood pressure cuff is
      connected to a pressure transducer for providing a pressure signal and a
      microphone is used for providing an electrical signal from the Korotkoff
      sounds detected. The Korotkoff sound electrical signal is amplified and
      passed through a bandpass filter which has a flat response between
      approximately 50 and 160 Hz and a sharp cutoff below 50 Hz. The resultant
      signal is then summed with the pressure signal to provide an output which
      indicates the pressures at which the five phases associated with the
      Korotkoff sounds occur.

PAL  A cast for broken limbs and related method, the cast comprising a
      cylindrical, double wall sleeve fabricated of a thin polymeric or
      elastomeric material and containing a cylindrical batt of fiberglas or
      like reinforcement impregnated with a polymeric catalyst. The opposed ends
      of the cast are constructed so that the spaced sleeves are sealed one to
      another and also to the cylindrical batt of the fiberglas or the like,
      which is concentrically disposed within the cast intermediate the spaced
      sleeves. Spacers may be used to maintain said concentric relationship. The
      cast comprises a plurality of breather ports, the edges of which are
      sealed as are the ends of the cast. When it is desired to use the cast, a
      suitable polymeric material is injected through a filler port into the
      interior of the cast between the two spaced concentric sleeves. The
      physician manually kneads the resin within the cast causing the catalyst
      initially contained within the central reinforcement to become mixed into
      the polymer thereby initiating polymerization. The filling vessel is
      detached and the cast is placed upon the injured limb of the patient. A
      conventional wrapping, such as an elastic roll bandage, is placed on the
      cast to exert pressure causing the same to conform precisely to the
      exterior surface of the injured limb. The wrapping is removed once the
      resin has set and adequately cured.
PAC  BACKGROUND
PAR  1. Field of Invention
PAR  The present invention relates broadly to the art of placing a cast on an
      injured limb and more particularly to a novel cast comprising a pair of
      concentric sleeves sealed at the ends and containing therebetween a
      cylindrical batt of reinforcement impregnated with a resin activating
      substance which initiates polymerization when comingled with a suitable
      polymer, and a related method.
PAR  2. Prior Art
PAR  Heretofore, the use of a cast comprising plastic interior and exterior
      walls have most frequently utilized a polymeric foam in the interior
      between the sleeves. This has created a number of problems because it is
      difficult to control the foam and often the cast becomes a
      pressure-applying device rather than an instrument which restrains
      undesired movement of the limb. Also, such an approach prevents adequate
      breathing of the skin in the vicinity of the cast. As a consequence, the
      medical profession has used only to a limited extent such an approach.
PAC  BRIEF SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
PAR  With the foregoing in mind, it is a primary object of the present invention
      to provide a novel cast for injured limbs and related methods.
PAR  Another paramount object of the present invention is the provision of a
      novel cast wherein the cast comprises spaced concentric sleeves sealed one
      to the other at opposed ends and containing therein a cylindrical batt of
      reinforcement impregnated with a catalyst wherein a polymeric material is
      injected between the sleeves into contiguous relation with the
      reinforcement and is caused to be polymerized when mixed with the
      catalyst.
PAR  It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel cast
      comprising a plurality of breather holes intermediate spaced cylindrical
      walls of the cast.
PAR  These and other objects and features of the present invention will be
      apparent from the following detailed description, taken with reference to
      the accompanying drawing(s).

PAL  A drape for use in surgical procedures having a base sheet of a
      liquid-repellent material and including a generally U-shaped fenestration
      with a layer of adhesive surrounding the fenestration and providing for
      varying the dimensions of the fenestration. The adhesive is protected by a
      plurality of cover strips which permit the drape to be applied in a folded
      condition to the patient and unfolded with reduced danger of
      contamination. In a preferred embodiment the drape also includes a
      foam-film laminate layer on the top surface thereof around the
      fenestration for placement of instruments, increased protection against
      liquid strike-through, reduced glare, and controlled absorbency. In use,
      the drape of the invention may be combined with other drapes, and an
      application is described including a stocking and a bar sheet for complete
      protection in complicated procedures such as knee or hip surgery. An
      improved method of folding the drape of the invention for increased safety
      and convenience is also described.

PAL  A disposable diaper having a moisture-impermeable backing sheet and an
      absorbent pad superposed on the backing sheet is provided with tab-type
      fasteners which do not require a release sheet for protecting adhesive
      surfaces thereof. Each fastener is secured to the backing sheet and
      comprises a pair of terminal portions and a flexible central segment which
      connects the terminal portions. One of the terminal portions is attached
      to the backing sheet and the other, free terminal portion is releasably
      attached to a release surface provided on the terminal portion which is
      attached to the backing sheet. The flexible central segment is longer than
      the free terminal portion and forms a finger-receiving loop when the free
      terminal portion is removably attached to the release surface.

PAL  Defective or unwanted tissue is removed such as from the lens of an eye by
      directing a pulsating high velocity liquid jet onto the defecting tissue
      to disintegrate the tissue and sucking the liquid entraining the
      disintegrated tissue from the area adjacent the tissue by a suction
      conduit. A control system is provided to insure the proper amount of
      suction. The control system also monitors the suction conduit and in
      response to a sudden change in pressure resulting from a clogging
      condition, the sucking action is reversed causing pressure to be forced
      through the conduit. Salt crystals can be added into the liquid stream of
      the pulsating liquid to improve the cutting action.

PAL  A smokers' pipe reamer comprises a hollow body, a forward portion of which
      has three longitudinally extending radial grooves and bearing slots, each
      extending radially from a respective one of the grooves to the interior.
      In each of the grooves a reamer blade is guided, this blade having a
      U-shaped appendage protruding into the interior. Three pins held in the
      forward portion of the body extend through the openings of respective ones
      of the appendages to permit radial and swiveling motion of the respective
      reamer blades. Radial movement of the blades may be adjusted by a pin
      having a conical tip adapted to bear against the radially innermost
      portions of the blade appendages. The pin is adjustable along the
      longitudinal axis of the reamer body by means of screw threads and a
      guiding slot, thereby limiting radially inward movement of the appendages
      and the blades while permitting the blades to swivel about each of the
      three pins.

      hopper feeds the coins one at a time to a downwardly inclined track
      assembly wherein sensing means detect the presence and determine the
      denomination of the coins as they move therepast. A signal is generated
      which is proportional to the denomination of each coin and then the
      signals are totaled.
PAL  The foregoing Abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the
      Application which, of course, is measured by the claims, nor is it
      intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way.

PAL  A ballcock assembly in which a sheath extends upwardly through the fluid
      within a reservoir tank to support a valve mechanism above the normal
      level to which fluid will rise in the reservoir tank. An inlet tube which
      connects a fluid supply line to the valve mechanism extends through the
      sheath and is wholly isolated from the fluid within the reservoir tank by
      the sheath. The outermost lateral dimension of the inlet tube and the
      innermost lateral dimension of the sheath are such that the inlet tube is
      completely circumscribed by an air space comprising a passageway that
      extends the full axial extent of the inlet tube between its effective
      connection to the valve mechanism and its effective connection to a fluid
      supply line. The passageway is required to communicate with atmosphere at
      a level beneath the fluid in the reservoir tank and may also communicate
      with atmosphere at a level above the normal level to which fluid will rise
      within the reservoir tank.

PAL  A high pressure gas tank safety and service valve which comprises a body
      portion that sealingly engages a threaded opening of a high pressure gas
      tank. The valve has a flow passage that communicates the interior of the
      gas tank to an outlet port of the safety and service valve; the flow
      passage including first and second axially spaced valve seats which are,
      respectfully, engageable by first and second valve members interconnected
      by a safety rod. The first valve member is operable to open and close
      communications between the interior of the high pressure gas tank and the
      outlet port of the valve to permit selected exhausting of the gas tank.
      The second valve member is normally bias toward engagement with the second
      valve seat and in the event of a fracture resulting in the escape of gas,
      the second valve member will automatically close communications from the
      tanks. A third valve seat disposed between the interior of the tank and
      the second valve member is engagable by a third valve operable to close
      communication with the interior of the tank when the pressure therein
      drops to a predetermined minimum valve. The third valve member carries a
      valve element which facilitates repressurization of the tank while the
      third valve member is engaged with its associated valve seat.

PAL  A control valve controls fluid to and from a motor or the like from a
      rotary shaft and it includes a pair of stationary valve members facing
      each other and having facing annular channels therein. The annular channel
      of one of said stationary valve members communicates with a motor passage
      leading to the motor. The annular channel of the other stationary valve
      member communicates with a source passage leading to the fluid source and
      with a vent passage leading to atmosphere. A pair of plugs secured in this
      latter annular channel provides an arcuate source channel and an arcuate
      vent channel. A rotatable valve disc driven by the rotary shaft and
      arranged between the stationary valve members has a port therethrough
      which alternately communicates the annular motor channel in said one
      stationary valve member with the arcuate source channel and the arcuate
      vent channel in the other stationary valve member for controlling the
      fluid to and from the motor or the like. The rotatable valve disc
      preferably includes a pair of discs and intermediate resiliently
      compressible means. The control valve also preferably includes a housing
      for receiving the stationary valve members and the rotatable valve disc.
      Lubricating means are also provided for lubricating the running contact
      between the rotatable valve disc and the stationary valve members.

PAL  This invention relates to the art of pressure vessels and more particularly
      to a valve assembly for use in a pressure vessel of the type having a
      rigid container with a deformable bladder therein, dividing the container
      into two variable volume chambers, one adapted to receive gas under
      pressure and the other to receive liquid under pressure.
PAL  The valve assembly which is screwed into a port in communication with the
      gas chamber includes a slidably mounted stem having a resilient valve
      member at one end normally urged to seat on the beveled inner end of an
      axial bore in the valve assembly in a first seating position of the valve
      member, and urged further into said beveled inner end when the bladder is
      charged with gas under pressure in a second seating position of the valve
      member. The inward movement of the valve member is limited by a stop
      carried by the stem. When the liquid chamber is charged, if the bladder
      should abut against the resilient valve member, no extrusion of the
      bladder would occur.

PAL  Sintered ceramic articles having a high surface area-to-weight ratio and
      containing a plurality of ducts that extend through the article to permit
      fluid flow therethrough are prepared by forming an extrudable admixture of
      pulverized ceramic material. The admixture is forced through a forming
      zone in which initial shearing forces form the admixture into a plurality
      of discrete ribbons, and the discrete ribbons are flowed into the upstream
      ends of a plurality of spaced, longitudinally-extending members to form a
      web member containing a plurality of longitudinally-extending ducts as the
      ribbons flow together about the members. Monolithic ceramic structures
      formed by the above-described process and including hexagonally-packed
      circular ducts, that is, circular ducts surrounded by six other circular
      ducts with each surrounding duct spaced an approximately equal distance
      from the axis of the circular duct it surrounds, exhibit a desirably high
      ratio of transverse compressive strength to longitudinal compressive
      strength.

PAL  In a control mechanism for automatically operating a warp beam in a loom, a
      comparison regulator is associated with a thread guide roller over which
      the warp passes and the regulator, through a cam arrangement, operates
      micro-switches for controlling the operation of an electric motor. The
      electric motor drives the warp beam through the medium of a variator.
      Further, an automatic zero setting is associated with the warp beam and
      operates in cooperation with the variator.

PAL  An apparatus for the orderly dispensing of wire to form a harness,
      comprising a strand pay out head which is moved by an automated control
      unit in two dimensions over a layout table having strategically positioned
      pegs and wire gripping elements thereon such that the wire is engaged in
      one of the gripping elements, entrained around certain of the pegs,
      secured in another of the gripping elements and cut, the entire process
      being performed repeatedly and automatically to lay all of the wires of
      the particular harness in the required configuration. The wire pay out
      head has a swivel mounted feed unit which receives wire from a continuous
      source and ordinarily the end of the wire projects slightly from the feed
      and is automatically retained by any of the gripping elements upon the
      passage therethrough of the feed unit, subsequent to which a knife on the
      pay out device cuts the wire if such is required for the harness being
      made.

PAL  A method and apparatus for removing tread from tires preparatory to
      retreading of the tires in which a tire is mounted on a support and
      inflated and rotated on the axis of the tire. The tread is removed from
      the tire by a cutter disc which has cutting elements mounted thereon in an
      annular path with the annular path being presented to the periphery of the
      tire. The cutter disc and tire are moved relatively to cause the annular
      path of the cutter disc in which the cutting elements are mounted to
      traverse the tire from side to side and in a single pass across the tire
      the tread is removed therefrom. The relative movements between the tire
      and the cutter disc are under the control of a cam so that the proper
      contour is imparted to the periphery of the tire. The cutting elements
      mounted in the aforesaid annular path of the cutter disc are in the from
      of sharp edged discs of hard material which take clean chips from the
      tread of the tire thereby avoiding heating of the tire or the cutting
      elements and, likewise, eliminating smoke and dust that normally
      accompanies the removal of tread material by the use of a cutting device
      employing rasp elements therein.

PAL  The invention pertains to the continuous centrifugal casting of metallic
      and non-metallic tube onto the I.D. surface of a rotating hollow cylinder
      which acts as the initial mold of the tube forming operation. Molten
      material, to be cast to tube, is continually introduced into the entrance
      end of the centrifuge and the solidified centrifugally cast tube is
      continuously extracted from the exit end. The process is greatly enhanced
      as to casting rates and ease of extraction of the solid cast tube by the
      techniques of utilizing a vacuum on the interior of the tube, in its
      molten and solid state, and/or a positive pressure (above ambient)
      external to the solidified or partially solidified tube at the exit end of
      the centrifugal casting machine.

PAL  A flexible elongated strand-starting member curved lengthwise in a vertical
      plane has one end formed for temporarily plugging the bottom of a
      flow-through continuous casting mold. Extending from the opposite end of
      the starting member along one of its curved sides is a row of rack teeth.
      Spaced laterally from the mold and at about the same level is a storage
      housing that has a substantially vertical passage through it for the
      starting member, while a pair of reversible pinch rolls located about
      halfway between the mold and storage housing but at a lower level are in a
      position to grip the lower end portion of the starting member while its
      upper end is plugging the mold. The rolls withdraw the starting member and
      a metal strand attached to it from the mold and feed the starting member
      up into the storage housing passage where a vertical gear engages the rack
      teeth. An overrunning clutch operatively connected with the gear permits
      the gear to free wheel while the starting member is being pushed up
      through the housing by the pinch rolls until the lower end of the strand
      is past those rolls. The lower end of the strand then is bent down to
      separate it from the starting member and to straighten it while the
      starting member is supported by the gear, which is prevented by the clutch
      from turning in the reverse direction. After the strand has left the pinch
      rolls, the clutch is driven at a controlled speed in the direction that
      will allow the lower end of the stored starting member to return by
      gravity to those rolls so that it can be fed by them back to the mold.

PAL  A mold for continuous casting of slab ingots is constructed to have wide
      sides which extend lower than the narrow sides leaving gaps below the
      bottom edges of the narrow mold sides in which rolls are placed for
      engaging the emerging narrow side of the ingot held in the same level
      still by the wide sides of the mold. The force exerted by these rolls upon

PAL  A sludge heat treat system wherein a tube in the tube heat exchanger
      consists of multiple set of small tubes spaced inside of larger tubes. At
      the end of each run there is a return bend that conveys the fluid on the
      inner tube around to the next tube in the tube exchanger and also conveys
      the outer tube fluid to the next tube system. The inner tube system is
      carrying sludges that are obtained in a sewage treatment plant or an
      industrial waste treatment plant or any other type of treatment plant
      where sludges are produced and it is desired to heat treat these in order
      to release the bound waters and thereby effect a dewatering of the sludge
      cake which is not possible without sludge heat treat systems. The outer
      tube conveys a liquid which is usually water which has been treated. The
      outer tube conveys a liquid which is usually treated water which gives up
      the heat from an outside source to the sludge on the inner tube in a
      consistent manner. The inner tube takes the heat from the sludge and
      transfers it to the water to preheat the water. The return bend is
      designed so that the sludge on the inner tube is conveyed through the
      outside portion of the return bend and the water from the outer tube is
      channeled through a channel on the inner side of the return bend. Built
      into the return bend is a heating surface where there can continue to be a
      transfer of heat between the water and sludge within the return bend.

PAL  In order to increase the productivity of oil and gas wells, hydrochloric
      acid and phosphoric acid are pumped into the well. Thereafter, aqueous
      ammonia is forced into the bottom of the well by nitrogen under pressure.
      This produces a violent exothermic reaction in the formation around the
      bottom of the well which emulsifies the paraffin and disintegrates the
      limestone, so as to open the formation by forming large passages and
      cavities over large areas and distances, permitting the oil or gas to flow
      freely through the formation to the well bore.

PAL  A device is needed to rapidly suppress gasoline fuel fires which are
       star as a result of the rupture of military vehicle fuel tanks by
      armor-piercing projectiles. The present invention contemplates a fuel fire
      suppressing device in the form of two hollow panels pressurized with a
      fire suppressant substance, such as Halon 1301; the panels are located in
      the path that an enemy projectile would take during passage through the
      fuel tank. The opening formed in each panel by the projectile permits
      automatic discharge of the pressurized suppressant onto the fuel escaping
      from the tank.

PAL  A cultivator has an elongated frame and a plurality of rotary soil working
      members mounted side-by-side in a row that extends transverse to the
      direction of travel. The soil working members have depending tines that
      rotate about upwardly extending shafts which are connected to horizontal
      supports for the tines. A screening element extends along the front of the
      frame and is displaceable relative to the frame via a pivoted arm and
      spring arrangement that biases the element to a position closely adjacent
      to the connections between the tines and their supports. The elements are
      connected to arms that are jack-knifed and pivoted to turn about an axis
      located above the frame. A rotary soil compressing member may be attached
      to the rear of the frame.

PAL  A tiltable coupling has one end thereof connected to a down-hole drill and
      has the other end thereof connected to a section of drill rod. By using
      that tiltable coupling, it is possible to cause a down-hole drill to drill
      curved holes in subterranean formations. That tiltable coupling serves to
      connect the section of drill rod to the down-hole drill, and also serves
      as a conduit for the compressed air which must be supplied to that
      down-hole drill.
PAL  One preferred embodiment of the tiltable coupling has a fulcrum at one side
      thereof and has a piston at the opposite side thereof; and that piston
      will be left inactive whenever a straight section of the hole is to be
      drilled, but that piston will be actuated whenever a curved section of
      that hole is to be drilled. Sensors are incorporated into the tiltable
      coupling to indicate the attitude of the down-hole drill, and some of them
      lie in a plane at right angles to the plane in which the axis of the
      piston lies; and hence those sensors can indicate the attitude of the
      plane in which the curved section of the hole will lie.

PAL  A motor vehicle has an enclosed battery storage compartment with a door
      separating the compartment from an adjacent support surface that has been
      roughened to reduce slippage of persons stepping thereon. A battery holder
      has a mounting base in the compartment and a battery cell support tray
      mounted on wheels for rolling between a position on top of the mounting
      base, where the battery cells are housed, and a position on the surface,
      where the battery cells are inspected and serviced. Mounted to the tray is
      a handle having a horizontally extending grip portion for grasping to move
      the handle or tray and a vertical projecting lock portion for engaging a
      keeper, mounted on the mounting base, to lock the tray in a stationary
      position. When the handle is in a tray locking position, the grip portion
      of the handle extends adjacent the tray and the compartment door can be
      closed, retaining the handle in its locked position. When the door is
      opened and the handle unlocked, the grip portion of the handle extends
      outwardly from the tray for moving the tray. Stops limit the outward
      movement of the tray from the compartment onto the adjacent support
      surface and guides are provided to restrain tray movement laterally of the
      normal direction of movement between the compartment and the support
      surface. Wheel retainers are provided to limit upward movement of the tray
      above the base.

PAL  A known vehicle normally operating on independently suspended trailing arms
     nd pneumatic tires can be converted to a tracked vehicle by wrapping
      endless tracks around the tire tread areas in multiples of two. An
      expansible wheel-connector device is provided for causing the trailing
      arms and wheels to deflect in unison, thereby maintaining track tension
      and tire-track interengagement, minimizing uneven final drive torque
      loadings, and relieving the wheel bearing loads brought on by the addition
      of the track.

      of the valve members, with the road speed responsive means being
      operatively connected to the resistance offering means and being arranged
      so that in use as the vehicle road speed increases, or at a predetermined
      vehicle road speed the resistance offered by the resistance offering means
      to relative movement between the valve members is increased.

PAL  A bistable memory circuit is set by a first output signal produced when the
      driver is absent from his seat of the vehicle to produce an output signal
      and is reset by a second output signal produced when the driver sits down
      on his seat but fails to carry out a precautionary safety procedure to
      protect him to cease to produce the output signal. An AND gate circuit
      produces an output signal only when an output signal produced when the
      driver sits down on his seat and the output signal of the bistable memory
      circuit are concurrently present. An OR gate circuit produces an output
      signal when at least one of the second output signal and the output signal
      of the AND gate circuit is present to energize a solenoid to render
      shifting of the transmission from a parking or neutral position into a
      driving gear impossible.

PAL  A system for systematical detecting a leak of fluid from a long pipe
      comprising a plurality of apparatuses like microphones set at relatively
      large intervals within a relatively long limited space, formed by
      utilizing the wall of the pipe like a space within the pipe and extending
      longitudinally of the pipe. The apparatuses intercept sonic waves caused
      by the leak of fluid from the pipe propagated in the limited space. The
      system further includes an apparatus for detecting that at least one
      first-mentioned apparatus has intercepted the sonic wave caused by the
      fluid leak.

PAL  A removable step climbing assembly that includes a number of longitudinally
      separated, confined space defining pairs of brackets alternately located
      on opposite side of a vertically extending rigid member, such as a mast of
      a ship or the like. A pair of step defining units are provided each of
      which units includes a pair of longitudinally spaced flanges that may
      removably and concurrently engage the confined spaces of two of the pairs
      of brackets on opposite sides of the elongate member. As a person climbs
      up or down the elongate member, the step defining units are sequentially
      removed from the brackets in which they are supported and moved to
      adjacent free bracket to permit the person to use the units as steps in
      ascending or descending the elongate member. Resilient triggers are
      provided that automatically interlock with the bracket to prevent
      inadvertent disengagement of the step defining unit therefrom. The
      resilient triggers may be manually disengaged from the bracket by the user
      as the step defining units are moved upwardly or downwardly on the
      elongate member.

      comprises a pair of transversely spaced uprights mounted upon a common
      tiltable frame formed with cylinders for plunger-type pistons carried by
      the vertically displaceable members of the lift device. The latter members
      surround the uprights and preferably are in the form of one-piece tubes of
      cylindrical configuration. A lift carriage (fork) is shiftable upon these
      members and is engaged by the end of a chain passing over a pulley or
      sprocket wheel carried by the vertically shiftable members for relative
      displacement of the carriage and the latter members.

PAL  In a column of telescopically adjustable height, the two coaxial
      telescoping members may be adjusted axially after a control button in an
      axial bore of one member is depressed. A bracket, longitudinally split
      into two members, passes into the bore through a radial opening of the one
      column member and is anchored axially and radially by conforming
      engagement with the column member. The operating lever for the control
      button is pivoted between the bracket members outside the column bore so
      that a small angular movement of the exposed lever part causes the
      terminal part of the lever in the bore abuttingly to engage the control
      button and to depress the same.

PAL  A device for preventing the reversal of a power window motor, wherein when
      the motor is normally actuated, a coiled spring loosely fitted on a core
      coupled with a worm gearing is contracted by the core, and the friction
      between the outer periphery of the coiled spring and the inner periphery
      of a drum is weakened, so that an output piece is rotated to open or close
      window glass, while when it is intended to manually push down or pull up
      the window glass, the coiled spring is expanded by a dog of the output
      piece, and the friction is strengthened, so that the turning of the dog is
      checked to brake the output piece.

PAL  A fluid motor actuator, including a hydraulic cylinder, includes a cam
      which is extended to become engagable with a cam follower of an extension
      chute section which is hinged and folded within a first chute section
      during transport. When the cam engages the follower of the retracted
      extension chute section, the cam causes the extension section to pivot out
      of its retracted position so that both chute sections form a unitary
      elongated chute adapted for receiving and directing the flow of concrete
      from the bowl of the mixer to the construction site. The extension chute
      section is retracted when the pour is completed and the cam is moved to
      non-interfering relation with the chute against the yieldable resistance
      of a spring.

PAL  A power driven typewriter comprising a shiftable carrier supporting a
      rotatable and axially movable flexible type drum having a plurality of
      circumferentially extending rows of type characters thereon. Type keys,
      when depressed, each condition one each of two groups of actuators and
      cause operation of a power driven cyclically operable clutch which drives
      a power bail to operate the two conditioned actuators, one of which is
      effective to rotate the type drum from any position it may be in to a new
      position and the other actuator being effective to raise or lower the type
      drum from any position it may be in to a new position to thus align a type
      character corresponding to the key depressed at the printing position.
      Upon alignment of a selected type character, the type drum is flexed
      radially to cause an imprint. Means are provided to dampen torsional
      oscillation, wobble, etc. of the drum prior to imprinting.

PAL  In apparatus for aligning a stream of elongate articles, such as chocolate
      bars, delivered in a randomly ordered arrangement to a turntable, the
      apparatus including a stationary guide rail disposed above the turntable
      and extending along a path which spirals outwardly away from the axis of
      turntable rotation, the speed and reliability of the aligning operation
      are improved by forming the guide rail to have a series of breaks in the
      guide path which it defines and by disposing the rail so that articles
      come to abut only against the surface thereof which faces away from the
      turntable axis.

PAL  An apparatus for transporting and accumulating containers, specifically
      oval containers. A pair of opposed side guides are mounted adjacent a
      conveyer and define a transporting passage therebetween having a width
      only slightly greater than the small diameter of the containers so that
      the containers are transported therethrough in a direction substantially
      parallel with their long diameters. The conveyer has a further pair of
      side guides associated therewith spaced downstream from the
      first-mentioned side guides and spaced apart by distance substantially
      equal to the long diameter of the containers for permitting the containers
      to be accumulated substantially adjacent one another with the containers
      disposed with the long diameters thereof extending substantially
      transverse to the direction of conveyer travel. The first and second sets
      of side guides are connected by a set of inclined side guides which
      gradually taper outwardly from the first set to the second set for
      enabling the individual containers to be gradually turned through
      approximately 90.degree. relative to the conveyer as they are transported
      from the transporting zone into the accumulating zone.

PAL  A method for a surface treatment to form a hard layer including a IV-b
      group element of the Periodic Table on the surface of an iron, ferrous
      alloy or cemented carbide article in a molten bath, comprising preparing
      the molten bath composed of boron oxide and a IV-b group element,
      immersing the article in the molten bath and applying an electric current
      to the molten bath through said article, said article being used as the
      cathode, thereby forming a very hard layer comprising the carbide of said
      IV-b group element on the surface of said article. The method of this
      invention can quickly form a uniform and dense hard layer on the surface
      of the article and can be carried out in the open air.

PAL  A jewelry display and packaging box has a bottom and a cover connected
      together by a hinge for swinging to open and closed positions. The bottom
      has an upwardly facing display panel on which a piece of jewelry is
      detachably supported in a display position. The cover has a large
      concavity therein which faces toward the box bottom in the closed position
      of the cover. A jewelry support is mounted on the box and has one or more
      jewelry supporting portions which are disposed in spaced relation to the
      walls of the concavity, and above the level of the panel. The portions are
      arranged to suspend one or more articles of jewelry in spaced relation
      above, and in overhanging relation to, that portion of the display panel
      which is adjacent the hinge, and so that the articles extend partway into
      the concavity and hang in spaced relation to the concavity walls and can
      dangle and swing freely, whereby rays of light reflected and refracted
      from each dangling article continuously shift directions. Closure of the
      cover moves the support and each article supported thereby to a position
      in which the articles are fully enclosed in the box in spaced relation to
      the article of jewelry on the panel.

PAL  A display container comprising a molded plastic base having spaced
      elongated oval sides tapering to a open curved front end and a larger
      curved rear end. A bottom wall extends integrally from the periphery of
      the sides in a continuous length from a point on the top adjacent the
      front, around the front end, along the bottom, around the rear end, and on
      to the top. The opening extends from the front to the rear edge of this
      wall. The sides have opposed grooves extending adjacent the edges. A
      plastic flexible cover is slidably mounted in the grooves so that when it
      is pulled forwardly against the front edge of the wall, the container is
      closed, and when it is pushed rearwardly, the container is opened. An
      elongated bar is pivotally mounted adjacent the front end. A support
      extends from the bar designed to hold an article, such as a travel clock,
      or a watch, for display. The grooves are curved forwardly and upwardly to
      direct the rear edge of the cover against the support adjacent the pivot
      bar when the cover is pushed rearwardly to opne the container. This will
      tilt the bar and support upwardly to display the contents in a tilted
      position. When the cover is moved toward closed position the support drops
      back into the container.

PAL  An improved multipack container is provided for accommodating a plurality
      of cathode ray tubes during transportation and storage. The altered
      construction includes basic top and bottom rigid closure members formed of
      flame retardant plastic material. Positioned peripherally therebetween are
      two substantially U-shaped edge-oriented areal support members, such being
      opposingly located between the superjacently related ledges of the
      respective closure members. Since the forward portions of the U-shaped
      supports do not meet, a beneficial window opening is provided on either
      side of the multipack structure. Internal supportive and protective
      structural means are predeterminately located between the closures in a
      manner spaced from the peripheral support members. Upon assembly of the
      multipack container and placement of the tubes therein, a tight covering
      of plastic material is applied to contiguously encompass the complete
      multipack to provide a unitized assemblage. The reinforced construction
      effects a firmly secured multipack having flame retardative features,
      improved structural rigidity and enhanced protective characteristics.

PAL  A sterilizable, peelable pouch or tray for medical and surgical equipment.
      The pouch comprises two superimposed sheets, preferably of autoclavable
      plastic, interconnected by an edge-strip of folded-over plastic affixed to
      the exterior surfaces of the sheet. The strip extends around at least a
      portion of the perimeter of the sheet edges and serves to provide a
      readily separable interconnection between the sheets. The sheets are
      separated by merely peeling one sheet back, thereby ripping the
      folded-over strip at the juncture between the two sheets. The tray
      assembly is similar with an upper plastic sheet removably, peelably
      affixed to a lower formed plastic cardboard or metal tray by the perimeter
      strips.

PAL  A sheet feeding mechanism is described in which the sheets in a batch of
      sheets are sorted into different output stackers. The sheet feeding
      mechanism includes a buffer store for receiving and temporarily holding a
      batch of sheets while a predetermined batch value is verified, and a batch
      verifier responsive to the passage of each sheet along a given path for
      comparing a measured batch value with a reference value to derive an error
      signal. The sheets are extracted from the store one by one and a sheet
      sorting mechanism sorts the sheets into different output stackers. The
      sorting mechanism includes means responsive to the output of the verifier
      for segregating the sheets of the batch extracted from the store whenever
      the error exceeds a predetermined value.

PAL  To test the genuineness and/or condition of dollar bills or other
      substantially identical papers, one or more thickness gauges are
      positioned in the path of these papers and determine the deviations, if
      any, of the thickness of a passing specimen from a predetermined value or
      from the thickness of a reference specimen scanned concurrently therewith.
      The measured deviations are fed into a processor which counts positive or
      negative deviations within a multiplicity of incremental periods and
      determines the nature of any irregularity from the count of deviations of
      either sign. With three gauges measuring thickness along as many parallel
      tracks, the system may discriminate among such irregularities as gaps,
      overlappings, adhesive tape and dog-eared corners.

PAL  In a storage installation for liquefied gas in a storage vessel surrounded
      by a wall which forms a collecting space around the vessel, the surfaces
      of the ground of the collecting space and/or the wall comprise a layer of
      a heat insulating material, whereby any liquefied gas collected in said
      collecting space evaporates more slowly thereby reducing hazard from gas
      vaporized in said collecting space.

PAL  A liquid dispensing apparatus for sequentially gravity feeding the liquid
      contents from a plurality of liquid containers into a closed manifold for
      selective dispensing therefrom. The manifold itself is disposed in a
      generally horizontal position and includes a plurality of individual
      container receivers extending generally vertically upward therefrom and in
      liquid communication therewith. Each receiver includes means for
      supporting a liquid container in an inverted, vertically disposed position
      with successive ones of the containers having their liquid outlets
      positioned at a different vertical level than the liquid outlet levels of
      the other containers. This arrangement permits the establishment of an
      initial steady state liquid level wherein all the container liquid outlets
      are at least covered by liquid to prevent further liquid flow therefrom.
      When a selected portion of liquid is removed from the manifold for
      dispensing or other use, the initial steady state liquid level is
      temporarily lowered so as to uncover the highest vertically disposed
      container liquid outlet. This uncovering permits air to flow into the
      container to facilitate liquid flow therefrom until the initial steady
      state liquid level is again reestablished to block further liquid flow. At
      all times during liquid dispensing from the manifold itself, replacement
      liquid is only drawn from the container having its liquid opening at the
      highest vertical level and which also has liquid therein. The arrangement
      further includes a normally closed flow valve associated with each
      container. A container support and sealing means is provided for each
      receiver to assure proper location and retention of the containers
      relative thereto.

PAL  A cap for a caulking cartridge of the type having an elongated dispensing
      spout extending generally coaxially outward from one end thereof. The cap
      includes a spout receiver which, when the cap is in position, closely
      embraces a portion of the elongated spout to prevent undesired emission
      and hardening of the caulking or the like compound during cartridge
      storage between uses. The cap also includes a resilient u-shaped bead
      receiver for closely engaging the end of the caulking cartridge adjacent
      the dispensing spout and structure releasing the cap from its engaging
      position. The releasing structure may also be used for conveniently
      hanging the cartridge during storage. The cap is dimensioned so at least
      the outermost end may be received in another, substantially identical
      cartridge at the opposite end from its dispensing end for ease of packing,
      shipping and shelf storage purposes as to a substantial number of the
      cartridges having the caps. A forming blade may be attached to the side of

      reciprocal screw extruder for plasticizing and injecting the material into
      a mold cavity, and wherein an injection piston in a cylinder is
      operatively connected to the plasticizing screw to push the screw forward
      to effect injection into a mold of plasticized material in front of the
      screw. A supply of fluid pressure is positively applied to the injection
      piston to provide a back pressure to act against the reaction caused by
      the rotation of the plasticizing screw, and this back pressure may be
      regulated to correspond with the rearward displacement, of the screw.

PAL  A resiliently deformable low inertia capstan for driving magnetic tape in a
      digital tape transport is comprised substantially of plastic material
      having a low elastic modulus and provides substantial rigidity in a
      circumferential direction as well as accepting substantial deformation in
      other directions without damage. The capstan includes a rigid inner hub
      defining a concentric cylinder, a thin-walled cylindrical outer rim
      disposed concentrically about the inner hub, and a pair of thin-walled,
      somewhat conical side members interconnecting the hub and rim at opposite
      ends thereof. Circumferential grooves in the outer surface of the rim
      improve capstan aerodynamics and a thin coating of polyurethane on the
      lands of the rim improves the coefficient of friction. Holes through the
      outer rim reduce the inertia of the capstan, may be selectively spaced to
      indicate a desired rotational velocity when strobed at a selected
      frequency by a light source, and may be used in conjunction with negative
      or positive fixed pressure to respectively increase or decrease frictional
      engagement between a driven tape and the rim.

PAL  A method of fabricating a sandwich structure consisting of a compliant
      sheet and a rigid sheet, the sheets being separated by a core. The
      compliant sheet is adapted to conform to the shape of the rigid sheet and
      the irregularities of the core through the utilization of the compliant
      sheet as an integral part of the tooling to provide a self-contained
      vacuum bag, wherein the compliant sheet is caused to be formed into
      intimate contact with the core.

PAL  The centrifuge comprises a centrifugal bowl having means for alternately
      opening and closing its outer periphery to discharge separated sludge
      intermittently from the separating chamber, there being a stationary
      paring disk in a paring chamber of the bowl for discharging separated
      liquid from the bowl while its outer periphery is closed to maintain a
      normal liquid level in the bowl. The paring chamber has an air passage
      located radially inward toward the bowl axis from this normal liquid level
      and adapted to discharge air from the bowl to atmosphere while the liquid
      is at said normal level, the liquid level moving radially outward in
      response to opening of the bowl's outer periphery. A dam rotating with the
      bowl limits this outward movement of the liquid level in the paring
      chamber so as to maintain therein a minimum liquid level during the sludge
      discharge, and means in the paring chamber are operable at this minimum
      liquid level to prevent air from being sucked into the bowl through the
      air passage during the sludge discharge.

PAL  This invention relates to a method and apparatus for obtaining the angle of
      attack of an aircraft developed as a result of an appropriate processing
      of the vertical speed, the airspeed, and the pitch attitude of the
      aircraft. The latter involves resolving the inverse sine of the vertical
      speed signal over the airspeed signal, and subsequently differentially
      combining the end product of the inverse sine computation and the chord
      line angle signal. The air speed signal is corrected by a corrective
      network which receives a feedback signal proportional to the angle of
      attack as well as a signal proportional to drift angle.

PAL  A multiple zone air conditioning control system is disclosed in which air
      temperatures in respective individual zones are governed according to
      signals derived from sensed air temperatures in the respective zones and
      sensed temperature of air discharged to the respective zones.
PAL  A zone set back unit is employed for setting back the air temperatures in
      all or any individual ones of the zones. The set back unit superimposes a
      set back signal on the temperature signals from the set back zones to
      effect a reduction of the air temperature in those zones as well as to
      prevent the sensed temperatures of air discharged to those zones from
      affecting the set back signal. The maintenance of air temperatures in
      zones which are not set back is unaffected by operation of the set back
      unit.

PAL  A spray gun with a retractable stem for opening a spray jet to the outflow
      of a liquid to be sprayed, also opens the compressed air inlet upon
      rearward movement of the stem. The compressed air flows about the stem and
      into a venturi throat through which the stem passes. The venturi educts
      atmospheric air so that the air that atomizes the liquid is at greatly
      reduced pressure. Rearward movement of the stem is also effected by
      compressed air that actuates a piston to move the stem rearwardly.

PAL  An impact sprinkler having several specific features is disclosed herein.
      One such feature resides in the use of a plastic water deflector having a
      number of cooperating water deflecting surfaces which improve the overall
      water distribution pattern of the sprinkler, specifically at the outlying
      areas of the pattern. Another feature of the sprinkler disclosed herein
      resides in the particular configuration provided for allowing the water
      deflector to pibot vack and forth. Regarding this second feature, the
      sprinkler disclosed herein typically includes a journal pin about which
      the water deflector can pivot. Located between this pin and the water
      deflector is at least one longitudinally extending slotted passage open at
      opposite ends. This passage provides a path through which abrasive
      material can escape should such material get lodged between the pin and
      deflector.

PAL  In an emergency locking safety belt retractor, a locking bar is operated by
      inertia responsive means which includes an inertia responsive mass and a
      locking bar for locking with teeth of the ratchet wheel associated with
      the belt winding wheel of the retractor. The inertia responsive means has
      been improved by the provision of having resilient means in force
      transmitting relation between the lock bar and the mass for receiving and
      storing energy imparted thereto by movement of the mass and for thereby
      urging the lock bar toward locking engagement with the ratchet wheel
      through a pawl bounce condition. The pawl bounce condition is defined as
      the condition that occurs when the lock bar initially bounces off the
      tooth of the lock wheel before attaining a locking engagement with the
      wheel. The resilient means may take the form of several different
      embodiments. In one embodiment, an actuator is mounted between the mass
      and the lock bar. A resilient stem is connected between the mass and the
      actuator, and the resilient stem may either be a spring wire or a coil
      spring. In another embodiment, the resilient means is mounted between the
      actuator and the lock bar and may either take the form of a diaphragm or a
      elastomeric material which absorbs energy in either stretching or
      compressing, or it may comprise a spring mounted on the lock bar for
      engagement with the actuator to absorb energy from the lock bar to the
      actuator.

PAL  A steam generator on the aircraft selectively delivers high-pressure steam
      to atmospheric discharge jets on a lift rotor and/or to peripheral jets on
      a forwardly-directed propulsion propeller. The propeller is enclosed by a
      hollow shroud into which the steam jets discharge so that the shroud acts
      both as a propeller efficiency-enhancing device and a steam condenser to
      permit recycling of the condensate.

PAL  The angular configuration of a fluid control surface, with respect to the
      relative direction of fluid flow, is controlled by selectively heating the
      structural portions of only one side of the control surface to expand the
      structural members on the one side with respect to the structural members
      on the other side for warping the control surface generally from its
      leading to its trailing edge. Particularly, the camber of an airplane wing
      is changed by this selective heating for controlling the wing portion
      lift. Preferably, wires extend generally from the leading edge to the
      trailing edge of the wing as wing structural members closely adjacent the
      upper and lower surfaces of the wing, with both sets of wires being
      prestressed to provide an intermediate camber for the wing portion when
      the upper and lower wires are the same temperature, a generally
      symmetrical wing configuration when only the lower wires are heated, and a
      high lift maximum camber when only the upper wires are heated. The wires
      may be electrically heated by the passage of current therethrough, closely
      adjacent the wing surface for air cooling, deeply embedded in the wing
      structure for insulation, or contained within concentric tubes conducting
      a cooling or heating fluid. Further, the wires may be organic synthetic
      fibers with electrically conductive material embedded in them for thermal
      expansion, or a composite of electrically conductive and non-electrically
      conductive fibers for thermal expansion, or composed of an
      electrostrictive material to shorten upon the passage of electrical
      current, or of composite structure as above mentioned, with an
      electrostrictive component for shortening with the passage of a current.

PAL  A device for shielding a heated surface from infrared detection through an
      exhaust opening adjacent the heated surface which comprises an exhaust gas
      conducting member adapted to receive heated exhaust gases from the exhaust
      opening with the member having a configuration which blocks the exhaust
      opening from line-of-sight view through the outlet to the member. The
      exhaust gas conducting member includes apparatus to inhibit heat transfer
      across its interior surface while promoting heat transfer through the wall
      of the member. Additionally there is provided a diffusion device for
      breaking up a main stream of heated exhaust gas into a plurality of
      smaller streams to reduce infrared radiation from the exhaust gas which
      includes a body adapted to receive heated exhaust gas with insulation
      apparatus to maintain the exterior surface of the body at a relatively low
      temperature. A plurality of openings in the body provide discharge of
      smaller streams of exhaust gas. The openings may be shaped to provide a
      cross-sectional configuration for the smaller streams of exhaust gas which
      promote dissipation of heat and energy and which reduce the emissivity of
      the gas streams.

PAL  An apparatus is disclosed for arresting uncontrollable motions of model
       araft. A signal is used to deploy a parachute when a model aircraft is in
      a motion, such as a tailspin, from which the operator cannot recover by
      manipulating the flight surfaces. After the model aircraft has been
      stabilized to a point where the operator can arrest the uncontrollable
      motion the parachute is jettisoned and normal flight resumed. The deploy
      and jettison signals may be sent using a single channel of a multi-channel
      transmitter and are completely independent of each other.

PAL  An anti-derailment system to prevent train derailment due to axle failure
      sulting from journal bearing overheating includes a thermal sensor to
      continuously monitor the temperature of the bearing and to activate the
      brake system when the temperature exceeds a predetermined level. A
      thermally-responsive element located in the journal bearing adapter
      physically deforms to activate a power source. The resulting signal
      initiates an electroexplosive brake line venting mechanism, puncturing and
      venting the brake line to stop the train. Several configurations of the
      thermal sensor and the power source are possible.

PAL  Safety device for controlling a valve. For application to a valve for
      controlling fluid flow, there is provided a normally inoperative device
      which the operator must consciously and deliberately render operative
      before the valve can be changed from one setting to another. In the
      illustrated embodiment, a valve activating device is held in inoperative
      position by suitable resilient means. To render same operative, the
      operator pushes the operating device against such resilient means into
      engagement with a desired portion of the valve for effecting the desired
      operation. As shown, such operating means automatically disengages only in
      one selected position of the valve, such as the "off" position, but
      remains engaged while the valve is in the other position, such as the "on"
      position. It is, however, possible by a simple modification to render same
      automatically disengageable as the valve attains either position.

      on the post while securely attaching it to the post to prevent relative
      movement between the fencing and the post. An elongated holding member
      having an inside surface corresponding generally to the outside surface of
      the post holds the fencing against the tape. Bolts, or other suitable
      securing means, join the post and the holding member together thereby
      holding the fencing material against the tape and the post. The fencing
      material is preferably a fabric material, while the post is relatively

PAL  A method is disclosed for preparing mixtures of moldable plastic and a
      suitable amount (generally a minor amount) of additive material to be
      dispersed throughout the moldable plastic, which mixtures are intended for
      subsequent use in a plastic molding process, by a method which permits
      separation or re-classification of the mixture into its moldable plastic
      and additive material components in the event that the mixture turns out
      to be incorrect or obsolete. The method includes the steps of obtaining
      small pellets of a moldable plastic having a first shape, these pellets
      being substantially free of the additive material. These small pellets of
      moldable plastic are then mixed with small pellets of moldable plastic
      into which has been incorporated one or more additives, these pellets
      having a second shape which is classifiably different from the shape of
      the other plastic pellets.

      coaxially with the drum for ignition and sintering of a charge using air
      and gas supplied to the hearth. The loading of the sintering grate with a
      bed and charge, as well as the discharge of finished agglomerate are
      effected through top and bottom seal valves. The drum is mounted on hollow
      journals which also serve for removing exhaust gases. The peculiarity of
      the invention is the provision, in the unloading zone of the drum, of a
      box-shaped housing having the form of a sector in the cross-section which
      is stationary mounted within the drum coaxially therewith and open on the
      side facing the sintering grate, and fixed air conduits disposed coaxially
      within the hollow journals for supplying compressed air into the box of
      the housing under a pressure substantially exceeding the pressure within
      the casing.

PAL  A workholder or roll-over fixture including a primary supporting structure
      and a pair of workholding elements mounted for rotation in the structure
      about a fixed axis of rotation and providing a work-receiving area
      therebetween. The workholder is particularly suitable for servicing and
      maintaining large and heavy machinery. The workholder includes a control
      system including a sensing means that is sensitive to out of balance
      forces within the workholder caused by rotation of the workpiece when held
      by the workholding elements and movement of the center of gravity of the
      workpiece relative to the axis of rotation. This control system also
      preferably includes a device mounted on one of the workholding elements
      which is adapted to sense the attitude thereof. The sensing means provides
      an output signal, which is sent through the attitude sensing device,
      indicative of the out of balance forces. Adjusting means are responsive to
      this output signal and effect positional adjustment of the workholding
      elements on the structure relative to the axis of rotation. This
      positional adjustment tends to decrease and remove the out of balance
      forces by moving the center of gravity closer to the axis of rotation. The
      preferred adjusting means include a hydraulic motor and lead screw mounted
      in and on each of the workholding elements.

PAL  An amusement device simulates the game of tennis and has a miniature
      playing surface provided with the lines and net that characterize a tennis
      court. Hitting elements representing opposing players are disposed on
      opposite sides of the net, and a wire extends over the net and has its
      ends anchored near the respective elements. The wire simulates the path of
      a ball, and a bead is threaded on the wire to represent the ball. The two
      hitting elements are mounted for oscillation about upright axes, and a
      cam-operated spring drive alternately actuates the elements in a manner to
      strike the bead and propel it back and forth over the net to simulate the
      action in tennis.

PAL  A plastic annular floor is attached to the ground by tacks. The outer
      periphery of the floor is bent vertically upwards to form a wall. A
      circular vertical band abuts the outside of the wall. The floor is held
      against the band by clips which are driven into the ground. Thus, a squat
      vertical cylinder with a wide diameter is formed, with an open top. In
      winter, the cylinder can be filled with water which after freezing can be
      used to provide a surface for skaters. In summer, the cylinder without
      water can be used to provide a surface for roller skates.

      throwing device has an outer surface formed of major and minor surfaces
      which have a common axis of symmetry and are convex relative to a plane
      perpendicular to the common axis. The major and minor sub-surfaces each
      have an extremal point along the axis with the major sub-surface point
      being farther from the plane than the minor sub-surface point. The major
      sub-surface is a segment of a substantially spherical segment.

PAL  A lid is pivoted to the base of a record player for movement between a
      closed position and an open position. A leaf spring is secured to the base
      at one end thereof. A detent is mounted to the remote end of the leaf
      spring for movement between (1) a protruding condition subject to
      engagement with the lid when closed, and (2) a retracted condition
      releasing the lid if closed. A plunger is reciprocably mounted for
      cooperation with a lid release button. A slide is movably mounted in the
      base adjacent the leaf spring for movement between (a) a position
      interposed, and (b) a position not interposed, between the plunger one end
      and the leaf spring. The plunger responsive to operation of the release
      button moves the detent to the retracted condition, via the slide and the
      leaf spring, if the slide is in the interposed position. If the slide is
      not interposed, the release button is ineffective to actuate the detent. A
      linkage is provided between the cam and the signal pickup carriage of the
      player for moving the slide to the interposed position and not-interposed
      position when the carriage is, respectively, in a standby mode and a
      playback mode thereby preventing opening of the lid during playback.

PAL  A lip seal for use between two relatively-rotating surfaces, and in which
      the contact pressure increases with distance from the sealing lip for
      preventing the leakage of fluid therebetween irrespective of the direction
      of relative rotation. The seal has projections on the "air" side of the
      sealing lip (that is to say, the side remote from the fluid to be sealed)
      which so engage one of the relatively-rotating surfaces as to have a
      contact area of which two opposite sides extend away from the sealing lip
      portion and diverge away from each other.

PAL  A sealed joint between two members. The joint utilizes a gasket that
      includes a rigid plate having a generally U shaped corrugation therein
      that forms a recess in one face of the plate and a raised rib on the other
      face. The face having the raised rib has a layer of elastomeric material
      thereon on opposite sides of the rib for sealing engagement with one of
      the members. Elastomeric material is also contained within the recess for
      sealing engagement with the other member. One of the members may have a
      recess for receiving the gasket and the depth of the recess may be greater
      than the axial thickness of the rigid plate at the corrugation whereby the
      members do not impose axial compression on the corrugation when the joint
      is tight. In another form of the invention, the rigid plate may have
      another corrugation spaced from the first corrugation and of slightly
      greater axial length. This gasket may be used between two members, neither
      of which has a recess, and wherein the second corrugation is engaged by
      the members to limit the amount that the members may be brought toward
      each other and thus prevent the members from imposing axial compression on
      the first corrugation.

PAL  A device for producing a seal between movable and/or stationary parts, such
      as a piston and a cylinder particularly under conditions of high fluid
      pressures, comprises a sealing ring having an O-ring configuration and
      fabricated of a material such as rubber. A support ring is disposed on at
      least one side of the sealing ring in coaxial relation thereto, the
      support ring being fabricated of a thermoplastic polymer material having a
      hardness greater than the sealing ring and being formed with a concavely
      curved contact surface facing and engaging the sealing ring. A guide ring
      having an L-shaped cross section is disposed outside of the support ring
      relative to the sealing ring in coaxial relation to the sealing and
      support rings, and consists of a polymer material having a hardness
      greater than the thermoplastic polymer of the support ring. The guide ring
      includes a side surface in planar engagement with a planar contact surface
      formed on the support ring on the side thereof opposite to the concavely
      curved contact surface, the engaged planar surfaces having substantially
      the same dimensions in a radial direction, and the said guide ring also
      defines a peripheral sliding surface extending substantially perpendicular
      to its said side surface and having an axial dimension greater than the
      axial dimension of the support ring. The sealing ring, support ring, and
      guide ring are mutually displaceable relative to one another and have no
      mutual interconnections therebetween.

PAL  A ski brake for bringing a lost ski on a ski slope to a halt, comprises
      arms which pivot under spring action into an operative position in which a
      pointed front end of each arm digs into the snow when the ski boot leaves
      its bindings. Insertion of the ski boot in the binding causes a pedal to
      be depressed onto the ski and the pedal moves the arms back into an
      inoperative position almost parallel to the ski. The rear end of each arm
      is hollow and contains a spring-loaded piston which bears on a cam. In one
      embodiment the cam is fixed relative to the ski, and the piston and the
      arm pivot around the cam surface under the action of the spring when the
      pedal is released. In another embodiment the cam is part of the arm and
      forms a pivot mounted to rotate in a bearing in a part of the ski. The cam
      is pivotted by the spring-loaded piston which in this embodiment is
      slidably mounted in a sleeve fixed relative to the ski.

PAL  A ski binding includes a soleplate, integral with a boot sole or adapted to
      carry a boot, to which a plate is hinged at one end about a transverse
      axis, this plate having an opening with a bevelled edge which passes about
      and comes to jam under the head of a pin fixed perpendicular to the ski. A
      spring urged locking member acts on the other end of the soleplate to
      releasably hold said other end against pivoting about said transverse axis
      or about said pin, and to releasably jam said opening under the head of
      the pin. A fixture can be provided for locking said plate on the ski
      whereby, when said locking member is disengaged, the soleplate is freed
      for pivoting about the transverse axis e.g. during ski touring.

PAL  A vehicle body includes a manifold extending transversely of the instrument
      panel adjacent the windshield. An oval-shaped, slotted diffuser is secured
      to the manifold and communicates with a source of pressure fluid. An
      occupant restraint cushion includes an unbilical portion communicating
      with the diffuser and also includes a pillow portion. The cushion is
      stored within the manifold. A cover is provided for the manifold. When the
      source of pressure fluid is communicated with the diffuser, the diffuser
      expands from an oval shape toward a round shape and relocates the slots
      during such change in shape. This moves the cover to an open position. The
      umbilical portion is then projected rearwardly of the body and is located
      between the windshield and instrument panel when inflated. The pillow
      portion is erected generally vertically of the body rearwardly of the
      frontal portion of the instrument panel.

PAL  Two uniform sheets are separated from each other by a corrugated member.
      The alternating ridges of the corrugated member are spot-welded to the
      inner surfaces of the two sheets. One of the sheets forms an impact
      receiving surface and has rows of slots, each row being located between
      the ridges. Upon impact, the slotted sheet is fractured and the adjoining
      spot-welded sections of the corrugated member are progressively deformed
      to distribute the impact force over a large area.

PAL  A hybrid system is described for inflating an automobile passenger
      restraint bag. Part of the gas for inflating the bag is stored in a high
      pressure gas reservoir. Another portion is generated by combustion of a
      pyrotechnic mixture. In a preferred embodiment the gas storage cylinder
      and pyrotechnic generator are coaxial with an axial gas flow passage
      through the pyrotechnic generator for collecting and conveying gas. A
      frangible diaphragm separates the pyrotechnic gas generator from the high
      pressure gas storage vessel. The gas generator has four compartments
      surrounding the gas flow passage, each containing a pyrotechnic gas
      generator grain. Combustion gas flows from one of these compartments
      through another and thence to the axial gas passage. In each embodiment
      the two inflation gas sources are in series with the inflatable bag rather
      than in parallel with each other.

PAL  An inflatable garment or suit of clothing worn by a motorcycle rider is
      detachably connected with a source of pressurized gas operative to inflate
      the suit in response to a predetermined deceleration of the motorcycle, or
      manual operation of a trigger adjacent the motorcycle hand grip when a
      crash or spill appears to be inevitable. If the rider jumps or is thrown
      from the motorcycle, the suit will pull loose from the gas source by
      virtue of the detachable connection and will remain inflated for an
      appreciable time interval to protect the rider from multiple impacts. The
      detachable connection is also manually operative to permit the rider to
      disengage the suit in its non-inflated condition from the gas source
      without triggering the latter, and thereby to leave the motorcycle while
      still wearing the suit.

PAL  A trailer suspension system eliminating jackknifing of the towing tractor
      and trailer assembly, providing stability to the trailer and more
      efficient braking especially during emergency stops and materially
      increasing vehicle maneuverability. Steering control is provided by a
      connection with the towing tractor in laterally offset relation to the
      vertical pivot axis formed by the kingpin and fifth wheel articulate
      connection between the towing tractor and trailer. The steerable wheels in
      the trailer suspension are supported by a generally right angular spindle
      structure connected to walking beam assemblies for pivotal movement about
      generally vertical axes which are oriented forwardly of the horizontal
      axis of rotation of the steerable wheels with the spindle assemblies being
      interconnected by parallel, vertically spaced rods provided with universal
      connection with the spindle assemblies for maintaining proper orientation
      of the steerable wheels during their steering movement and during relative
      vertical movement. The trailer suspension includes independently and
      resiliently supported axle and spindle assemblies in the form of a two
      axle or three axle tandem assembly with the resilient independent support
      for the suspension axles effectively maintaining wheel contact with the
      ground surface for more effective braking and greater vehicle stability.

PAL  This dolly frame has a cross member upon which a pair of ground wheels are
      rotatably mounted and from which laterally-spaced opposite side members
      project forward. These side members terminate in wedge-shaped coupling
      members pivotally connected to coupling member adapters permanently
      secured to the rearward portion of the towing vehicle chassis, thereby
      providing limited rise and fall of the dolly relatively to the adapters.
      The center of a transverse leaf spring mounted on the cross member engages
      the lower end of a trailer hitch ball structure mounted on a cross-head
      which is in turn connected to a shock absorber to thereby dampen the
      oscillation of the leaf spring and thereby eliminate the pitching
      otherwise transmitted to the towing car as a jerking motion back and forth
      when the dolly hits a bad bump.

PAL  A lottery ticket which consists of a continuous strip of sheet material is
      perforated along predetermined lines and folded to provide a three-layer
      ticket in which the lottery number is placed on the bottom layer. The
      perforations are disposed in the two upper layers and define areas that
      can be readily broken to form lug portions. The ticket number on the
      bottom layer can be revealed only by pulling on the lug portions which
      will tear off along the perforated lines. In this manner the ticket is
      permanently and irreparably altered.

PAL  The invention relates to a pressure fluid coupling and in particular a high
      pressure hydraulic coupling. The coupling comprises two hollow flanged
      members, one of which carries a spigot having an O-ring near its end. The
      spigot is inserted into the bore of the other member and when it homes,
      the front faces of the flanges will abut. A resilient clip clips over the
      flanges to hold the coupling members together. Both coupling members may
      however be female members and a coupling device having "O"-rings near its
      ends may be inserted into the bores of coupling members.

PAL  An expansion compensator suitable for controlling the thermal expansion of
      a pipeline between fixedly disposed components, which comprises a linear
      pipeline extending between a pair of longitudinally spaced
      stress-susceptible pipeline components, a longitudinally spaced pair of
      linear strain equalizers interposed in the linear pipeline between and
      spaced inwardly from the components, and a pair of overlapping
      longitudinal anchors affixed to the linear pipeline, each of the anchors
      further overlapping one of the strain equalizers the combined distances
      between the outer end of each of the anchors and the adjacent component
      being substantially equal to the amount of overlap of the anchors.

PAL  A hose coupling and joint in which a nipple insertable within a relatively
      hard but flexible tube, such as reinforced nylon, has a long smooth
      tapered portion at its outer end and a series of barbs at its inner end
      whose edges define a reverse taper, the barb of largest diameter being at
      the inner end of the smooth tapered portion and no larger than the inside
      diameter of the hose to permit ready insertion of the nipple into the hose
      without damaging the latter. The hose is held upon the nipple by a band
      type clamp that encircles the hose opposite the barbs.

      release tube that is mounted on a latch body to retract a pair of latches
      when said tube is moved axially outwardly relative the latch body, and an
      overshot coupling rod secured to the latch body and extended through the
      coupling member. The lowering overshot assembly has a lock coupling for
      releasably couplingly engaging the coupling rod that upon pulling on the
      lowering assembly with more than a given force will release coupling
      engagement of the lowering with the coupling rod. The retracting overshot
      assembly has a collet that will couplingly engage the coupling member upon
      lowering the retracting overshot assembly, and that upon withdrawing the
      retracting overshot assembly moves the latch release tube to first move
      the latches to a retracted position and then retract the inner tube
      assembly.

PAL  A knockdown modular enclosure structure that is adapted to convert vehicles
      for use either as mobile security or detention carriers for transporting
      prisoners, animals or the like or as a means of transportation in which
      the passengers are protected from persons outside the vehicle. In one
      embodiment the passenger or load space on the bed of a truck is enclosed
      by a series of knockdown panels defining the walls and roof of the
      enclosure. The panels are separably and detachably interlocked without the
      use of fasteners and in such a manner that they cannot be removed from
      either inside or outside the enclosure when at least one of the panels,
      which provide a doorway for entering and leaving the enclosed space is
      closed. The driver's compartment is protectively enclosed by an additional
      array of panels fitting over the windshield and windows or window spaces
      of the compartment. In vehicles having a roofless driver's compartment, a
      panel construction is provided for enclosing the top of the compartment as
      well.

      may be removed after deflation, simply by rotating a cylindrical removable
      outer rim so as to disengage a respective locking lug on the wheel from a
      corresponding recess on the removable outer rim. There are eight locking
      lugs spaced 45 degrees apart on the fixed rim of the wheel and
      corresponding recesses in the removable outer rims so that without
      removing the fixed wheel rim from the hub of the automobile it is possible
      simply by rotating and pulling to remove the removable outer rim after
      first deflating the tire and then it is possible to remove and replace the
      tire without the use of bead breaking or bead stretching equipment by
      inflating the tire back to normal pressure thereby locking the removable

PAL  An anti-skid control system for decreasing braking distance performance of
      a braked wheeled vehicle while maintaining the lateral stability thereof.
      The system is comprised of a digital data logic processor responsive to
      only wheel deceleration and wheel velocity of the braked vehicle for
      iteratively or alternatively preselectively attenuating and restoring an
      applied brake fluid pressure, so as to cause the brake system performance
      to track the knee of the road-torque versus wheel velocity envelope as a
      function of time. The only parameters employed are wheel deceleration,
      wheel velocity and mode time for mode-switching between the several
      control modes (selective brake pressure attenuation and restoration)
      employed, while the modes themselves include preselective time-scheduling
      of the respective brake pressure attenuation and restoration.

PAL  A drive belt assembly for snowmobiles. The assembly includes an endless
      drive belt, which extends substantially across the entire width of the
      rear portion of the snowmobile, and is longitudinally and drivably
      supported on the snowmobile body. First and second sets of transversely
      and alternately positioned and spaced drive cleats are securely mounted on
      the outer surface of the drive belt. Each of the cleats has a first end
      portion which is adjacent one of the lateral edges of the belt, and a
      second end portion, which is spaced inwardly from the other edge of the
      drive belt. Surface portions are defined on the outer surface of the track
      longitudinally between each of the first end portions of one set of the
      drive cleats, and transversely between the second end portion of each of
      the other set of cleats, and the other edge of the drive belt. Flexible,
      unitary, lugs or projections extend from the outer surface portion. The
      drive cleats, which are of a futigue resistant design, and the flexible
      projections cooperate to provide forward traction for the snowmobile,
      while avoiding side slippage of the snowmobile as it is driven across the
      snow and/or ice.

PAL  An agitator shaft for revolving attached blades within a fluid containing
      tank rotates in support bearings free of any attachment to the tank. A
      shaft mounted housed seal unit exteriorly of the tank comprises a packing
      gland and a fitting connected by a flexible tubing with the fitting having
      a bore and the tank having a complementary opening each substantially
      larger than the diameter of the shaft. The shaft extends axially through
      the fitting and opening into the tank and the fitting is secured in the
      opening. The flexible tubing is designed to absorb torque from the seal
      unit and such unit permits the shaft to be mounted with equal facility and
      efficiency on tanks of plastic, rubber or metal and materially reduces
      shaft alignment problems.

PAL  A novel pad-type fluid wedge sliding surface bearing in which the
      individual pads have a swing-like motion to produce a lubricating wedge
      between the face of the pad and the moving surface. The center of swing
      for each pad is located so that the fluid friction moments and the
      pressure moments on the pads oppose each other. The moment equilibrium
      position of the pads will form a wedge converging in the direction of
      motion of the moving member. In achieving this condition, the pads may be
      constructed of a metal-elastomer laminate section with the laminal
      arcuately formed about a center located in the direction of the opposing
      sliding surface.

PAL  An annular shoulder on the radial bearing is contacted by the thrust
      bearing raceway radially inwardly from the inside periphery of the thrust
      bearing cage. Either the thrust race or the annular shoulder on the radial
      bearing, or both, may have an integral axial extension with the thrust
      race and the radial bearing interlocking radially inwardly from the inner
      periphery of the thrust bearing cage.
PAL  The bearing is pressed in to the bore of the housing by pushing against the
      thrust race with the force against the thrust race being transmitted by
      way of the annular shoulder to the radial raceway. Thus, it is not
      necessary to push the bearing into the housing bore by pressing against
      the thrust rollers which often results in critical damage to the thrust
      race.

PAL  This disclosure relates to a full complement bearing and the method of
      forming the same wherein the rollers of the bearing are hollow and are
      installed between the bearing races in a preloaded condition. Further, the
      rollers have the end portions thereof relieved so that only the central
      portion of each roller is cylindrical. Such a roller bearing produces
      highly desirable and unexpected results. First, the runout of the bearing
      is at a minimum. In fact, utilizing lower grade components, a full
      complement hollow roller bearing formed in accordance with this disclosure
      will have the superior minimum runout of a much higher grade bearing
      utilizing solid rollers. In addition, the life expectancy of the full
      complement bearing is much greater than that of like full complement
      bearings having solid rollers.

PAL  A bearing lock is provided which can be inserted, tightened, and removed
      from the exterior of a rotating machine without disassembly of the end
      bell of the machine. Positive guiding means insure that the locking
      portion will only engage a bearing outer race. A portion of the bearing
      lock comprises a lever which turns about a housing portion fulcrum as a
      tightening means is torqued. As the locking member is displaced, an
      angular extension of the lock is drawn into engagement with the outer race
      and transmits an axially directed force thereon. When secured in operating
      position, the body of the lock has minimal axial projection thereby
      avoiding interference with adjacent structure.

PAL  A sequence of containers of equal width and rectangular form with flat
      horizontal bottoms and flat vertical sides and ends can be placed in
      sequence one directly above another to form a self-supporting stack of
      vertically expanded height. By reversing the sequence, the containers can
      be placed one directly above another to form a self-supporting nest of
      collapsed height. The individual containers are symmetrical in shape both
      longitudinally and laterally and, except for incremental differences in
      length, can be identical in construction. The end-to-end relationship of
      successive containers can be the same for both stacking and nesting or
      individual containers can be turned end-for-end at will for either
      stacking or nesting. The compressive strength of the end panels provides
      strong support for either stacked or nested containers through upper and
      lower integral abutments on the end panels which fit against the side
      panels of underlying containers, when nested, and overlying panels, when
      stacked. When stacked or nested, adjacent containers are locked against
      relative longitudinal displacement by overlapping end panels and are
      locked against relative lateral displacement by end panels fitting between
      side panels of adjacent containers. The containers are easily adapted to
      serve as a wardrobe and play beds for dolls, being fully enclosed when
      nested and laterally open when stacked.

PAL  A circuit panel connector for enabling the connection of a plurality of
      circuit terminals at the edge of a circuit panel, such as a printed
      circuit board, with external conductors includes an elongate socket and
      self-aligning bifurcated electrical contacts juxtaposed with the socket
      along the length thereof, each having a pair of opposed cantilever tines
      integral with a common base and carrying contact lobes at the free ends
      thereof such that both tines are free to flex resiliently relative to one
      another for the reception of the circuit panel edge between the tines,
      while the contacts are free to move laterally, relative to the socket, for
      alignment of the contacts with the circuit panel edge in response to
      insertion of the circuit panel edge within the socket, and a strap
      integral with the base of each contact and extending laterally into a
      tubular connector element having means for releasably clamping an external
      conductor against the strap within the tubular connector element.

PAL  A connector for supporting a printed circuit board in electrical and
      mechanical connection to the wrapping posts or pins of a wire wrap panel
      without interference to wrapped wire connections at the pins includes a
      housing, electrical contacts arranged in opposed pairs within the housing
      for movement between cocked position for receiving the pins and locked
      position for locking engagement biting into the pins, and means for
      retaining the printed circuit board in the housing. The contacts are moved
      to locked position by inserting the leading edge of the printed circuit
      board into engagement therewith, and each contact provides a connection
      between an electrical circuit on the printed circuit board and a
      respective pin.

PAL  An incident light illumination device or instrument for generating dark and
      light field illumination, wherein at least one optical component is used
      in a region where the dark field and the light field illumination beams
      are kept in separate zones. The inner zone is traversed by the light field
      beam and is endowed with an index of refraction other than the outer zone
      which is traversed by the dark field beam. A switchable stop for
      eliminating the light field beam is provided in the vicinity of the
      optical component (s). The index of refraction of the inner zone of at
      least one optical component is selected so that the light source is
      reproduced in the rear focal plane of a microscope objective. A mirror
      designed as a rotating body and reflecting from its inside surface is
      located in the optic path from the optic component to the microscope
      objective and this mirror solely reproduces the dark field beam as a light
      ring in a plane on the rear side of the microscope objective.

PAL  An electro-optic modulator used to modulate coherent light beams by the
      application of an electric potential. It combines a Fabry-Perot etalon and
      a diffraction grating in a single unit. An etalon is constructed with an
      electro-optic material between reflecting surfaces. A voltage applied
      between alternate, spaced-apart electrodes of a metal grid attached to one
      reflecting surface induces a diffraction grating in the electro optic
      material. Light entering the etalon is diffracted, reflected and
      efficiently coupled out.

      direction perpendicular to the optical axis in response to the zooming
      operation for varying the distance from the portion of the first movable
      member to the pivoting point of the pivotable member. The first movable
      member is also movable integrally with the second movable member, in a
      second direction parallel with the optical axis in response to a pivoting
      of the pivotable member for moving the movable lens group along the
      optical axis for focusing. In this manner, the amount of movement of the
      movable lens group is varied in accordance with the distance from the
      portion of the first movable member to the pivoting point of the pivotable
      member.

PAL  An adjustable speed projector including a continuously running shutter for
      repetitively interrupting the projection light path at a rate which is
      independent of the film frame rate, a source of film frame advance signals
      having a repetition rate controllable by an operator, and means for
      advancing a film by one frame in response to each advance signal at a time
      corresponding to the next succeeding interruption of the projection light
      path by the shutter so that the film is in motion only at times when the
      shutter interrupts the light path. The film-advancing mechanism includes a
      continuously rotating drive wheel, a driven wheel which is caused to
      engage the drive wheel for one cycle in response to each actuating signal,
      and a claw, one end of which is eccentrically mounted on the driven wheel
      and the other end of which engages a film sprocket hole to advance the
      film by one frame for each cycle of the driven wheel. A single spring
      urges the driven wheel into engagement with the drive wheel and also urges
      the claw into engagement with the film and against a lateral guide
      surface. Two-channel recording and playback apparatus is provided so that
      film frame advance signals recorded in synchronism with a sound track may
      be used to control the projector in the playback mode.

PAL  A concave mirror is positioned at an angle to a flat surface containing a
      picture so that a viewer can view the picture as reflected to his eye by
      the concave mirror. Masking is provided about the marginal edges of the
      concave mirror to define within the masking a reflecting area less than
      the total area of the picture. As a result, the degree of visibility of
      the top, bottom, and side portions of the picture can be changed by the
      viewer shifting his line of sight, the masking means defining a window
      which appears closer than the viewed picture so that a three-dimensional
      effect results. Perspective and keystone effects resulting from the
      angular relationships are compensated for by varying the width dimensions
      of the masking and the manner in which the picture is formed on the flat
      surface.

PAL  An interferometer arrangement of either the transmission or reflection type
      incorporating at least a pair of partially spherical or spherical elements
      having an index of refraction of approximately two is disclosed. In a
      preferred embodiment, the spherical or radiation directing elements are
      glass spheres having an index of refraction of approximately two at the
      wavelength of a light source being utilized. In a transmission type
      interferometer, both the spherical or radiation directing elements are
      utilized as beam splitters and collimators while, in the reflection type
      interferometer, one of these spheres is used as a beam splitter and
      collimator while the other is utilized as a retroreflector. The complete
      spherical symmetry of such radiation directing elements permits them to
      function with any orientation relative to the optical path between them.
PAL  Mechanisms in which desired motions are controlled with high precision by
      applying mechanical feedback to position a movable body relative to a
      fixed reference body, using the above described interferometer arrangement
      are also disclosed. The same mechanisms are capable of being controlled
      from a programmed computer causing the movable body to exhibit a desired
      motion using interference fringe detection schemes to both monitor and
      accurately position the movable body relative to a reference body.
PAL  Also disclosed is an actuator based on a hollow hydraulic cylinder having a
      given longitudinal axis which includes an interferometer arrangement
      incorporating at least a pair of spherical elements which have an optical
      axis substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of the actuator.
      Also disclosed are transducer arrangements disposed in series with the
      actuator which are utilized to meet high frequency stability requirements.

      system which comprise employing as the object or target the laterally
      moving-fringe pattern produced by convergence of two monochromatic
      coherent-radiation beams of equal size and intensity and slightly

      of the pattern to a width which is substantially wider than the element or

      multiple of the fringe period; positioning at least the portion of the

      that the article lies in a plane defined by the x and y axes of the fringe
      pattern and the element is in a position, relative to the article, such

      laterally shifting the fringe zone and/or the article along the y-axis to
      produce relative lateral displacement between them while maintaining the

      the central portion of the fringe zone; continuously determining the phase
      of the RF signal component of the radiation scattered or transmitted by
      the element as the relative lateral displacement between the zone and
      article continues from a first to a second position of the element within
      the fringe zone; simultaneously and continuously comparing the phase of
      the scattered or transmitted radiation RF signal with the phase of a
      constant reference RF of .DELTA.f frequency; and sensing the magnitude and
      direction of phase shift between the RF signal component of the scattered

      a gripping surface extending from a base. A deformable washer is then
      extended over the base. A stud member is provided with a receptacle end
      portion and positioned with respect to the base of the head so that
      interengaging and cooperating surfaces on the receptacle and base are
      aligned and provide locking apertures for receiving the washer. Finally,
      the washer is deformed so that it extends into the locking apertures
      thereby locking the stud member to the head and forming a unitary stud
      assembly.

PAL  A method for forming non-repeating stone patterns in fresh concrete
      including preparing the surface of the fresh concrete by bullfloating and
      the addition of color, if desired, imprinting into the fresh concrete
      indentations representative of the corners only of the stones in the
      pattern, imprinting separately connecting grooves between the imprinted
      corners. The method may further include the use of a plastic overlay on
      the fresh concrete prior to imprinting so as to provide a well rounded
      edge to the formed stones. A number of tools for forming the non-repeating
      patterns are also disclosed. One of such tools is a walking tool including
      a flat platform having a plurality of apertures, a shaft rotatably
      extended through each aperture, a hub on each shaft below the platform on
      which the platform rests, a flange on each shaft engaging the top of the
      platform, a plurality of imprinting blades extending from each hub to form
      a group, the top of each shaft having an anvil head to be pounded, and at
      least one of said apertures being elongated to render one group of blades
      both rotatably and laterally adjustable for varying the stone patterns to
      be imprinted in fresh concrete. Other tools suitable for use with the
      method include an individual group of blades arranged in the form of the
      corners of the stone to be imprinted, together with a striking area by
      which the blades can be pounded into the surface of the fresh concrete.

PAL  A method and apparatus for sensing the velocity of a fluid flow, especially
      within the boundary layer of a fluid flow path through a compressor. A
      reference flow under constant pressure is established through an orifice
      dividing two plenum chambers, and directed through a flow sensing opening
      in a probe positioned in the flow to be sensed. The flow sensing opening
      is slightly larger than the orifice. A relative pressure indicator
      connected to the two plenum chambers indicates the velocity of the sensed
      fluid flow. The flow sensing opening is arranged so that the normal
      reference flow of fluid therethrough is in the same direction as the
      normally expected flow direction of the flow to be sensed.

PAL  A fluidic governor system for controlling the speed of a drive shaft output
      of a prime mover, comprising a fluidic governor, a reciprocating or vane
      compressor, a fluidic RC filter, and a valve. The compressor is
      mechanically coupled to and driven by the drive shaft output of the prime
      mover, and generates both pneumatic power and a pulsating fluidic signal
      which has a frequency proportional to the rotation of the drive shaft
      output of the prime mover. The fluidic RC filter blocks the passage of the
      pulsating fluidic signal and converts the power output to a steady
      pneumatic power supply which powers the fluidic governor, while the
      pulsating fluidic signal is acoustically sensed by the governor. A speed
      error signal whose magnitude is proportional to the error in the frequency
      of the pulsating fluidic signal, is generated from a control output port
      of the fluidic governor for regulating the energy supply to the prime
      mover by means of the valve to correct the speed of the drive shaft output
      of the prime mover.

      multiple blades feathered at an angle perpendicular to the fluid surface,
      all enclosed within a casing which is contoured to the said rotor-blade
      assembly and its its related fluid movement area, said casing having a
      main suction chamber and a discharge chamber in line with each other and
      in line with the lower one third periphery of the rotor which requires the
      fluid to flow in a straight line through the pump. A supplementary suction
      chamber is located in the upper quadrant of the casing on its discharge
      side which furnishes additional fluid to the main suction chamber to
      balance the vacuum-pressure relationship of the two suction chambers and
      cause a rise of pressure behind the blade travel path, thereby minimizing
      or eliminating blade cavitation as well as increasing the supply and
      momentum of fluid through the main suction chamber.

PAL  An outlet diffusor for a centrifugal compressor built up from two planar
      discs and a number of elements shaped as segments of a circle interposed
      therebetween; each element is defined by two opposed shaped edge faces,
      which together with corresponding faces in adjacent segments form tubular
      passages in the diffusor; the geometrical form of these passages may be
      varied by altering the cross section of the channels or the spacing
      between the segments, and by mounting the segments so they are angularly
      adjustable so that the flow characteristics of the diffusor may be altered
      and during use.

PAL  A power plant of the windmill type is provided which includes a multi-arm
      horizontal propellor unit mounted for rotation about a vertical axis. Each
      propellor vane of the unit includes an external shell configured to form
      an elongated trough with an open trailing edge. A webbing is mounted
      within the shell to form a series of cells which are exposed through the
      open trailing edge. The shell has a parabolic cross section, and its
      leading edge has an airfoil shape. The propellor unit responds to wind
      from any direction so that the need for wind tracking mechanisms is
      obviated. Moreover, the construction is such that gyroscopic vibrations
      due to wind changes are also minimized.

PAL  A valve in the production flow line of an oil well closes a reed switch
      indicative of fluid being pumped through the line. The switch closure
      activates a first oscillator whose count is compared with a variable
      frequency oscillator having a frequency of approximately one-half that of
      the first oscillator. The comparison is made over a given period of time
      to ascertain the percentage of time the valve has been open and passing
      fluid. Theoretically, the valve should be open approximately fifty percent
      of the time because almost that much time is taken on the downstroke of
      the pumping assembly when no production is occurring. The integrated timer
      is adjusted to shut down the system when the percentage of time the valve
      is open drops to the preselected amount, usually equal to or less than
      around 50 percent. In response to the integration timer producing a
      signal, a shutdown timer is turned on which restarts the cycle after a
      preselected amount of time. The length of shutdown time for the pumping
      unit is preset according to the well fill-in rate. When the system is
      restarted by the shutdown timer, a pump-up timer is turned on which is
      adjusted to allow for a desired pump-up time. As the pump-up timer is
      allowing the system to recycle, the integration timer is reset and the
      recycling is completed if the requirements of the integration timer are
      met. Otherwise, the unit is shut down again and the system recycled. A
      variable electronic scaler is connected to the output of the integration
      timer which monitors the output signals from this timer.
PAL  A reset circuit between the integrator and the scaler resets the scaler to
      zero after a successful recycle of the system. A successful recycle occurs
      when fluid is pumped at a flow rate equal to or greater than the preset
      minimum when the pump has been restarted after a shutdown period. If the
      pumped fluid flow rate achieves the minimum preset flow value during or at
      the end of the pump-up period, a reset signal is conveyed to the scaler to
      reset it to zero and continue pump operation and system recycling
      indefinitely, or until malfunctions interfere with the pumping operation
      or production drops below a level economically feasible for pumping
      operations.
PAL  When malfunctions do occur, such as parting of the sucker rod, the pumped
      fluid flow rate will remain below the desired preset value and no reset
      signal will be conveyed to the scaler. At the end of the pump-up cycle the
      pump will not be pumping fluids and will be shut down in response to the
      signal from the integrator assembly. Since there will be no reset signal
      to the scaler, it will begin to accumulate the shutdown signals. After the
      preset number of times the integration timer produces a shutdown signal,
      the scaler turns off the whole system. It can then be restarted manually.
      This provides a safety device for equipment failure such as breaking of
      the sucker rod. Means are also provided for recording the various timed
      cycles and also for monitoring the number of signals transmitted to the
      scaler, thus being indicative of the number of times the system has
      automatically shut down and successfully recycled.
PAL  Also a circuit is provided to determine the exact percentage of time that
      the pump is producing fluid flow, whether above or below the preset
      minimum percentage. A continuous recorder may be used with this circuit to
      maintain a constant record of the percentage of time the pump is flowing
      well fluids to allow the operator to determine if the preset minimum
      percentage should be lowered, and how much it should be lowered to obtain
      successful recycling of the pumping system.

PAL  Portable, self powered water pumping apparatus for use in sampling water in
      remotely located wells comprises a wheeled hose reel cart which supports a
      long length of plastic hose or tubing. The tubing has a small diameter
      length of inner tubing telescoped inside itself throughout most of its
      length. The inner tubing passes through the wall of the outer tubing near
      the upper end thereof and is connected to a pressurized cylinder of gas
      such as a standard 14 oz. propane gas cylinder. When the lower ends of the
      tubes are well submerged beneath the water level in a well, admission of
      gas to the inner tube at its upper end will force water up through an
      annular space between the tubes and out the upper end of the outer tube
      where it can be collected. A channeled plug at the bottom of the tubes
      prevents the tubes from collapsing, helps to keep them straight and
      together as they are lowered into the well and provides partial support
      for a weight hanging from the bottom of the tubes.

PAL  A slurry pump including a pressure tank with an inlet and a lower outlet
      and having a pneumatically operated, inwardly opening closure at the inlet
      and a hinged, outwardly opening door at the outlet swingable between
      opened and closed positions. An external source of air under pressure
      hydraulically shuts the closure and pressurizes the tank, forcing a
      semi-liquid slurry such as liquid manure contained within the tank through
      the outlet and into a duct leading to a lagoon or the like. A slurry level
      sensor shuts off the supply of air to the tank when the slurry reaches a
      given level in the tank.

PAL  A metering pulse pump for metering an additive liquid into a liquid carrier
      under high pressure. A high-pressure, rapidly reciprocating piston pump is
      provided at its outlet end with a pressure-relief valve including a spring
      pressure control permitting the valve to open under varying pre-set
      pressure differentials across the valve. A diaphragm pump having first and
      second chambers separated by a diaphragm is provided with one of the
      chambers communicating directly with the outlet of the piston pump
      upstream of the pressure-relief valve, liquid carrier emitted under
      pressure from the piston pump serving to drive the diaphragm pump in a
      pumping stroke, the second chamber of the diaphragm pump having inflow and
      outflow ports with respective check valves permitting only inflow and
      outflow of an additive liquid into and out of the second chamber. The
      first and second chambers of the diaphragm pump are communicated through a
      manually closable bleeder duct having a check valve permitting flow only
      from the first chamber to the second chamber when the duct is open. The
      length of a diaphragm pumping stroke corresponding to a rapid piston pump
      stroke is controlled by the pressure differential setting of the
      pressure-relief valve.

PAL  A gear-driven transport ring rotates around a toroidal chamber. Spaced
      sealing rings carried by the transport ring divide the chamber into
      compartments which serve to transport liquid from a feed station to a

      station to bring the liquid up to desired discharge pressure and to
      transport it to, for example, the feed water intake of a steam boiler.

PAL  A six-cylinder swash plate air conditioning compressor having reciprocal
      double-acting pistons within a swash plate chamber positioned centrally
      between axially spaced front and rear cylinder blocks having intermediate
      suction and discharge gas crossover passageways in the cylinder blocks.
      The swash plate chamber provides a crankcase for receiving lubricant
      returned from the front head suction chamber by means of piston blow-by
      during the compression stroke of the pistons. The suction pressure in the
      crankcase is at a higher level than the pressue in the suction gas
      crossover passageway while being at a lower level than the pressure in the
      cylinder head gas discharge chamber creating the necessary positive
      pressure gradient to circulate the lubricant internally within the
      compressor. Radial slots are formed in the cylinder block outer faces to
      provide first and second internal lubricant differential pressure flow
      passages between the shaft thrust and journal bearings and the cylinder
      block suction cavities communicating via the suction crossover passageway
      to the front head suction chamber.

PAL  An overspeed shutoff device for use in a rotary pneumatic tool is
      disclosed. The device is operable to shut off air supply to the motor on
      failure of its governor to function properly in preventing overspeeding of
      the motor. The device includes a valve closing plate positioned in the
      path of air flow to the pneumatic motor, just upstream of an inlet port
      for passage of air into the motor. In normal operation of the tool the
      valve plate, which rotates with the motor drive shaft, is retained in a
      position spaced from the air inlet port by a locking mechanism engaging
      the drive shaft of the tool to prevent axial movement therealong. The
      plate locking device comprises a cantilever mounted spring wire in
      engagement with a groove in the drive shaft and a centrifugally responsive
      weight operably connected to disengage the wire from the groove in
      response to the attainment of a predetermined rotary speed. Upon failure
      of the main governor of the tool and consequent acceleration of the motor
      to such predetermined speed, the wire is disengaged from the shaft groove
      and the air pressure drop across the valve inlet port causes the closure
      plate to move toward and cover the inlet port, thereby stopping the flow
      of air to the motor.

PAL  An improved radial, pressure-balancing arrangement for fluid-operated
      devices of the geroter type wherein an externally-toothed star member is
      eccentrically disposed within an internally-toothed ring member to form a
      plurality of expanding and contracting volume chambers by tooth
      interaction. The ring member has a plurality of pockets receiving a like
      number of rollers rotatable therein which define the teeth of the ring
      member. Particularly configured recesses are located at predetermined
      positions within each pocket. The recesses are effective to provide a
      predetermined pressure pattern behind a selective roller at any particular
      time during the operation cycle. The pressure pattern thus formed biases
      the selective roller against a mating star tooth to seal volume chambers
      at high pressure from those at low pressure.

PAL  An expandable poincon assembly to be used for forming a headpiece onto a
      preformed thin-walled plastic or laminate tube or bag provides a poincon
      upon which the loose fitting preformed thin-walled tube can be loaded.
      After tube loading, the poincon is inserted into a female forming member.
      Toward the end of the poincon's insertion stroke, a soupape which is
      mounted for axially movement within the head end of the poincon contacts
      the female forming member and then partially retracts into the head end of
      the poincon as the poincon continues to advance to the end of its
      insertion stroke. A conically-shaped washer mounted on the bottom end of
      the soupape is peripherally expanded by the continued advancement of the
      poincon after the top end of the soupape has contacted the female forming
      member. As the poincon reaches the end of its forward stroke, which will
      be the closed position of the poincon relative to the female forming
      member, the expanding periphery of the washer makes contact with the
      preformed tube body at a location below the portion of the tube body which
      extends beyond the poincon to effect a tight sealing fit between the
      poincon, the tube body and the female forming member to define a mold
      cavity in which the headpiece to the tube body may be formed.

PAL  An apparatus for making a dual seal insulator including an insert and a
      pair of elastomeric seals each united to one of the ends of the insert,
      wherein portions of the insert and the seals define a plurality of bores.
      The insulator is formed by mounting the insert in a mold to form a pair of
      mold cavities at each end of the insert and placing core pins in the bores
      of the insert so that they extend from the insert across the cavities. A
      keyway, disposed longitudinally on the circumference of the insert between
      the ends thereof, cooperates with the enclosure to define a passage
      between the mold cavities. An elastomeric material is pressed into one of
      the cavities so that a portion of the material is forced through the
      passage into the other of the cavities. In this manner, the pair of
      elastomeric seals is simultaneously molded at opposite ends of the insert.
      The insulator is then cured and removed from the enclosure and the core
      pins are extracted from the bores. The invention includes the apparatus

PAL  Conjugate filaments containing components located in a side-by-side or
      eccentric sheath/core structure are formed by directing superposed layers
      of the polymer components across the surface of a spinneret plate into
      narrow channels, the channels being contained in a member integral with
      the spinneret plate, to form narrow streams which are extruded through
      extrusion orifices located below the narrow channels in a spinneret plate.

PAL  Thickness of a sheet being produced by an extruder is controlled in
      response to measurements of: sheet thickness, the speed at which material
      is fed through a screw of the extruder, as determined by screw speed, and
      the speed with which material is taken away from the extruder, as
      determined by sheet speed. Measured thickness is compared with a setpoint
      for sheet thickness and a determination is made as to whether the
      thickness is in a predetermined, deadband region relative to the setpoint,
      or if the sheet is out of the deadband because it is excessively thin or
      excessively thick. In response to the sheet thickness being in the
      deadband region, the screw speed is changed in response to a signal
      indicative of the product of sheet speed error and rate of change of screw
      speed with respect to sheet speed. Sheet speed is controlled by
      multiplying sheet speed error by a predetermined constant. In response to
      the sheet being excessively thin, screw speed, if it has not reached a
      maximum value, is changed by multiplying sheet thickness error by rate of
      change of screw speed with respect to sheet thickness; if the screw speed
      has reached a maximum value, sheet speed is changed by multiplying the
      thickness error by the rate of change of sheet speed with respect to
      thickness. In response to the sheet being excessively thick outside of the
      deadband region and the sheet speed has not reached a predetermined
      maximum, line speed is changed by multiplying sheet thickness error by the
      rate of change of sheet speed with respect to sheet thickness; if the line
      speed has reached the predetermined maximum, screw speed is changed in
      response to an indication of the product of sheet thickness error and rate
      of change of screw speed with respect to sheet thickness. The various
      rates of change are calculated from an equation which models sheet
      thickness, T, screw speed, V.sub.S, and sheet speed, V.sub.L, in
      accordance with:
      ##EQU1##
      where: A, B AND C ARE PREDETERMINED CONSTANTS DETERMINED FOR EACH EXTRUDER

PAL  A hydraulic wrench has a support, and a drive assembly which is mounted
      thereon and which includes a shaft that is turnable, a pair of sector
      drive plates which are mounted on the shaft turnable relative to the same
      and spaced from one another, each drive plate having an arcuate edge face
      formed with a plurality of slots that are spaced about the axis of the
      shaft and extend substantially parallel to this axis, and a square drive
      member which is turnable with the shaft and can be inserted into a mating
      drive socket. A transmission arrangement transmits motion from the sector
      drive plates to the shaft in order to turn the latter when the sector
      drive plates are turned. A hydraulic cylinder unit is also mounted on the
      support for pivotal movement about an axis parallelling that of the shaft
      and spaced therefrom, and the cylinder unit has a reciprocable piston rod
      having a working stroke and being provided with a projection that can
      engage in the respective slots of the sector drive plates, in order to
      turn the latter during the working stroke of the piston rod.

PAL  A molded plastic J-shaped trap or conduit has a U-portion with a laterally
      curved or slightly helical configuration to provide for automatically
      producing the conduit within a multiple cavity injection mold. The mold
      includes a set of mold sections which define a U-shaped cavity having a
      slight helical configuration, and a slight helical U-shaped core member is
      supported within the cavity by a core support rod and a set of core slides
      which engage opposite ends of the core member. The core member and one of
      the core slides are adapted to be elevated after the mold sections are
      opened to remove a molded conduit from the cavity, and the core member
      remains supported by the core support rod which extends through the one
      core slide. The molded conduit is stripped from the core member by an
      annular stripping plate which is moved by an actuator along the core
      member in a helical path, and the conduit is directed past the core
      support rod as the conduit is being stripped.

PAL  This invention cools the blowing mold and the plastic article blown therein
      to shorten the time that a core rod must remain at a blowing station of a
      blow molding machine for making plastic articles. The cooling is performed
      by conditioned air that is dried to lower its dew point. An air curtain is
      used to prevent other air from contacting with and depositing moisture on
      the mold. In order to take advantage of the shorter time at the blowing
      station, an auxiliary injection device is used to also shorten the time
      required for the injection operation; and auxiliary cooling is supplied to
      the core rod at the stripper station.

PAL  Pieces of steel scrap are charged into a ladle by a magnet on a crane so
      that the central part of the charge is substantially denser than the
      peripheral part. A cover having a plurality of natural gas-oxygen burners
      mounted around its periphery is then placed on top of the ladle to obtain
      a substantially gas tight container except for a flue opening and some
      small openings due to a non-tight fit between ladle and cover adjacent the
      top. The burners direct their flames downwardly parallel to the sidewall
      of the ladle and the combustion gases are discharged through the flue
      opening. The flames are reducing in nature and the container is under a
      positive pressure. The heating is continued until the scrap is at a
      temperature of at least approximately 1,500.degree.F and preferably
      approaching the melting point of the scrap. Molten iron in substantially
      greater weight that the scrap and having a substantially higher carbon
      content is then poured into the ladle so that the majority of the scrap is
      melted. The mixture is then easily poured from the ladle into the oxygen
      converter.

PAL  An electric lamp bulb type of heat furnishing unit is provided with a
      covering of active oxidation catalyst such that fumes and odors in the
      confines of a room that are drawn over the catalytic surface will be
      converted to less objectionable products. A light bulb type of catalyst
      supporting device is of particular advantage in that it can readily be
      screwed into a lamp base or other form of current supplying receptacle
      and, in addition, will provide a hot surface for inducing natural air
      convection current flow past the catalytic surface. Various types of
      coatings and/or catalytic wrappings may be used on the bulb to provide any
      particular type or form of catalytic surface.

PAL  Method and apparatus for simultaneously and continuously determining the
      total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen
      demand (COD) of an aqueous sample. The method involves first converting
      all inorganic carbon to CO.sub.2, the amount of which is determined. The
      organic carbon is converted, by treatment with an excess of an oxidizing
      agent, into CO.sub.2, which is conductimetrically determined (TOC), and
      the amount of remaining oxidizing agent is determined in a redox cell to
      ascertain how much of the oxidizing agent was consumed by the organic
      carbon. This is the COD.

PAL  In an apparatus for making organic fertilizer from waste organic materials
      by aerobic fermentation, the interior of an inclined slowly rotating
      digester cylinder is provided with a series of knives which gradually cut
      and shred the softer components of the raw material and a series of heavy
      chains located downstream from said knives, which said chains have
      overlapping loops which crush and grind hard and brittle components of the
      raw material, all while the material is in process of aerobic
      fermentation. Materials which resist the comminuting action of both the
      knives and chains are discharged with the digested organic materials and
      are then separated therefrom. The apparatus is capable of accepting and
      treating municipal garbage and refuse without prior separation of unwanted
      material, and without preliminary grinding of the material prior to its
      introduction into the digester.

PAL  An upright generally cylindrical casing forms a gas passageway
      communicating with the exhaust of a flue for receiving its heated exhaust
      gases. A burner, axially mounted below the casing in the heated gas
      stream, heats the gases and refractory material contained by the casing to
      a combustion temperature. Baffles in the casing direct the heated gases
      toward refractory vanes contained by the casing. Additional air is
      admitted to the depending end of the casing to support combustion of
      unburned hydrocarbons.

PAL  A device for generating gas at a constant rate for raising a water profiler
     uring measurement of different parameters of the sea. The device is of a
      specific construction including a housing with end caps. LiH is placed
      into the housing and capped. A blasting cap ruptures one end cap
      permitting water to enter the housing. The water mixed with the LiH
      generates hydrogen gas and LiOH which provides lift for a profiler. A
      plurality of the gas generators are assembled onto a profiler for causing
      the profiler to ascend as many times as the number of devices carried by
      the profiler.

      in the pattern being tested. The fixture is designed to facilitate
      attachment of each needle-holder blade to its pad on the card and to
      orient the blade before such attachment so that the needle point is
      precisely aligned with the related contact.

PAL  Membrane permeation processes to produce oxygen-enriched gas from
      atmospheric air are improved by initially contacting an ambient air feed
      with triethanolamine to substantially reduce the nitrogen dioxide content
      in the air and thereafter feeding the nitrogen dioxide depleted air to an
      array of membrane cells and finally withdrawing the oxygen-enriched
      permeate output therefrom, substantially free of nitrogen dioxide, for
      further use.

PAL  Membrane permeation processes to produce oxygen-enriched gas from
      atmospheric air are improved by feeding the air to membrane cells divided
      into two groups, independently withdrawing the permeate output from the
      two groups of cells into two conduits containing restrictions, and
      referencing the pressure of one output against the other. A subsequent
      imbalance of pressure between the two permeate outputs indicates a
      membrane leakage in one of the two groups of cells.

PAL  Apparatus for removing dust from a gas stream comprises a duct with an

      at a level between inlet and hopper. Gas flowing from inlet to outlet must
      traverse a vertically extending filter comprising elongated parallel
      electrodes laterally spaced from one another at small intervals. Each
      electrode is connected with a terminal of an alternating voltage source
      different from that with which its adjacent electrodes are connected. The
      constantly varying alternating electric fields at the filter repel
      particles so that they fall into the hopper.

PAL  An elongated cylindrical casing defines a contacting chamber of the type
      used in a gas effluent processing system. The casing is disposed with its
      longitudinal axis in a vertical orientation and has conduit means disposed
      to direct gas and liquid flows into the upper end of the chamber for
      generally downward concurrent intermixing progression whereby particulate
      matter is transferred from the gas flow to the liquid prior to discharge
      of the separate flows from the lower end of the contacting chamber. The
      lower discharge end of the casing has an improved structural configuration
      that overcomes certain problems inherent in prior art apparatus designed
      for accomplishing the same purpose. Flow control means is also disclosed
      for use within the chamber to further enhance the operational efficiency
      of the contacting chamber.

PAL  This application teaches a method of producing an article of glass by
      cutting it out of a sheet of flat glass. Flat glass is formed in a glass
      ribbon forming apparatus and is discharged therefrom at a temperature in
      excess of 1000.degree.F. The hot flat glass is moved under at least a pair
      of focused laser beams which cut patterns in the glass having a common
      starting and ending point. In such a manner, a glass article is cut from
      the ribbon. The article is removed from the remaining portion of the
      ribbon and cooled in a controlled manner to produce a final glass article.
      The cooling operation may be rapid or slow so as to produce a tempered or
      an annealed article.

PAL  Movable lateral and longitudinal dam barriers are provided in a glass
      forming chamber of the type containing a molten metal. The movable lateral
      dam barriers control longitudinal convection currents in the molten metal
      to control the temperature of the glass as it moves through the forming
      chamber. The lateral dam barriers can be moved to change longitudinal
      convection currents to achieve the optimum temperature conditions in the
      glass ribbon for producing flat glass of a specific thickness at any
      desired ribbon speed. The lateral dam barrier can also be moved to change
      convection currents and glass ribbon temperature to facilitate the change
      over from producing a glass ribbon of one thickness to a glass ribbon of a
      different thickness. The movable longitudinal dam barriers control lateral
      convection currents in the molten metal to flatten the edge-to-edge
      temperature profile across the ribbon of a glass ribbon moving through the
      chamber supported on the molten metal.

PAL  A furnace for heat treating glass sheet material including a circular
      enclosure having top, bottom and side walls of refractory material. Inlet
      and outlet openings are formed in the side walls. The side walls have an
      outer insulating layer and an inner layer of material having a low
      coefficient of thermal expansion, the inner layer having spaced end
      portions projecting beyond the outer layers and the periphery of the side
      walls to define said inlet and outlet openings. Each opening is controlled
      by doors, and each door includes an elongated support bar with a plurality
      of blocks of refractory material supported on the bar in end-to-end
      relationship. The blocks are adjustably secured to the bar to accommodate
      irregularities in the openings.

PAL  Glass compositions are disclosed that are particularly useful in comminuted
      form as sources of micronutrient elements for soils. The glasses are based
      on phosphorus as P.sub.2 O.sub.5 and contain a nutrient amount of a
      micronutrient metal in oxide form, such as zinc, copper, manganese,
      molybdenum, or boron oxides or mixtures thereof, plus a solubility control
      agent. The control agent is a metal compound or mixture of metal
      compounds, usually potassium or sodium oxide or potassium or sodium
      chloride, and is present in the glass to provide a controlled release of
      the micronutrient metal, both as to amount and rate.

PAL  A method of preparing a copper complex for use in eliminating the growth of
      marine plant life such as algae. The copper complex is provided by
      initially reacting an insoluble copper compound with an aqueous solution
      of an acid to dissociate the copper ions, and thereafter chelating the
      released copper ions to form a copper complex. The resulting complex has
      improved stability to both heat and light and contains an increased amount
      of copper compared to copper complexes formed by prior methods, thereby
      making the complex more effective as an algaecide.

PAL  In the Q-BOP process for the production of low carbon steels (eg. 0.02 -
      0.05% C), inert gas-oxygen mixtures are employed during the latter part of
      the blow, i.e. when the C content of the melt reaches a level of about
      0.25%. As such lower carbon contents, the rate of decarburization is not
      decreased by dilution of the oxygen with inert gas. However, such dilution
      results in less O.sub.2 being available for oxidation of iron, hence
      significant increases in metallic yield may be achieved. By precise
      control of the O.sub.2 /inert gas ratio, increases in metallic yield in
      excess of 2% are achieved.

PAL  Merrill slime is contacted with a gold chloride solution to cement out gold
      and dissolve base metals. The separated solids are treated in a known type
      of process by chlorination with elemental chlorine, separation of the
      chlorinated solution and precipitation of gold powder by means of a
      reductant. The precipitation is partial and the remaining solution is used
      for the cementation step. The gold powder is separated and subjected to
      special washing techniques for the removal of adsorbed impurities. A molar
      ratio of Cl/Au of about 4 after chlorination is aimed at to minimise the
      solubility of silver chloride. After removing solid impurities this ratio
      is raised to ensure that any dissolved silver remains in solution when
      gold is subsequently precipitated.

      earlier during oxidation of the material than either the Sn or Cd thereby
      acting as a nucleating site for the formation of the oxides of the Sn and
      Cd. The oxide of the metals appears to tend to grow as a mixture of the

PAL  An electrophotographic process comprising forming an electrostatic image on
      the surface of a sensitive member, transferring the electrostatic image
      onto the surface of a transfer member, and developing the image so
      transferred. The process specifically involves using an overcoated
      sensitive member consisting essentially of an electrically conductive
      base, a photoconductive layer and a light-transmitting surface insulating
      layer, subjecting the sensitive member to a primary charging in a specific
      polarity using a direct current corona discharge, exposing light and dark
      images on the surface of the sensitive member and simultaneously
      subjecting it to a secondary charging until the surface of the sensitive
      member has the same polarity as in the primary charging and its potential
      becomes substantially equal to the untransferable upper limit potential,
      exposing the entire surface of the sensitive member to render the
      potential of the dark image area higher than the untransferable upper
      limit potential without substantially changing the potential of the light
      image area, transferring the electrostatic image so formed on the surface
      of the sensitive member to the surface of a transfer member, and then
      developing the electrostatic image so transferred thereby to form visible
      images.

PAL  An improved photographic processing system and process are provided. The
      system includes a novel photographic recording medium comprising a layer
      of silver halide emulsion, a barrier layer disposed on a surface thereof,
      the barrier layer being soluble in aqueous alkali but insoluble in water
      and acidic media, and an acidic developer disposed as a layer on the outer
      surface of the barrier layer or mixed therewith. The developer is
      activatable at an alkaline pH. A novel processing web comprising a support
      containing an alkali and a free water source is also provided, which web
      is adapted for contacting the layer containing developer to initiate
      development of the silver halide. The developer thus is isolated from
      alkali and from the emulsion prior to developing. The process includes
      exposure of the recording medium, followed by the described contacting for
      development of a visible image. Nucleating and complexing agents can be
      included in the web, to remain with the web, to provide a positive print
      by diffusion transfer and/or to aid in stabilization of the photographic
      emulsion.

PAL  A light-sensitive composition comprising novel arylglyoxyalkyl acrylates
      that exhibits useful light sensitivity. The basic structure of the new
      compositions, which may also themselves be polymerized are as follows:
      ##EQU1##
      wherein Ar represents an aromatic structure selected from the group
      consisting of benzene, naphthalene and substituted products of each,
      R.sub.1 represents an alkyl group having from one to ten carbon atoms,
      R.sub.2 represents a grouping selected from the group consisting of
      hydrogen, or a lower alkyl group having from one to five carbon atoms and
      R.sub.3 represents an alkenyl group having from one to 10 carbon atoms and
      singular unsaturation. The light-sensitive compositions may themselves be
      utilized in photochemistry as photopolymers, they may be combined with
      suitable solvents and additives or polymerized with suitable backbone
      polymers to provide substances which can be used as light-sensitive
      coatings. These coatings may be placed on substrates and in one instance
      as presensitized lithographic plates.

PAL  An improved process for preparing a polishing solution for use in the
      chemical-mechanical polishing of silicon comprising copper nitrate,
      ammonium fluoride, nitric acid and ammonium nitrate. The latter two
      components are added to the copper nitrate, the system mixed well and then
      the ammonium fluoride added. The process eliminates the need for settling,
      decantation or filtration during solution preparation and permits
      substantially lowered amounts of copper nitrate to be used for silicon
      polishing. The silicon polishing solution is also described.

PAL  A cationic additive for starch which comprises a preferred condensate of
      epichlorohydrin with an equimolar quantity with dimethylamine, and in
      which a minor amount of up to 30 percent molar ammonia may be substituted
      for a like molar amount of dimethylamine. This condensate is preferably
      intimately admixed and utilized in an amount of 1-7 percent (preferred 5-7
      percent) with alkaline gelatinized or alkali hydrolyzed starch to give a
      liquid cationic treating agent for paper. The percentage of condensate
      additive is calculated using as a base granular or dry starch and the
      condensate is preferably added to the liquid gelatinous starch after the
      gelatinization or in situ during the gelatinization. The starch, during
      the addition of the condensate, is maintained alkaline by a preferred
      alkali metal hydroxide of about 5 percent strength. This cationic starch
      may be used as a wet end pulp additive in the range 3-50 lbs/ton and has
      shown to favorably affect burst strength and pigment retention values.

PAL  Method and apparatus for converting grains, beans, and like materials into
      flour, as highly water absorbent starch. The material is introduced into
      the annular gap between a stationary outer truncated cone member and an
      inner rotating truncated cone member. The cone members are on a vertical
      axis, smaller ends uppermost, and have axial grooves on the opposed
      surfaces forming regions to grind the material introduced between the
      surfaces. The cone members taper inwardly toward the top and at about the
      upper half the opposed surfaces of the cone members diverge while at about
      the lower half the opposed surfaces are substantially parallel. The cone
      members are relatively adjustable in the axial direction, particularly to
      control the size of the gap between the lower portions thereof. In
      operation, material to be ground is introduced between the cone members at
      the top and is reduced to flour along the upper portions of the members
      while along the lower portions of the members friction developed on the
      ground material causes it to become heated. The starch granules are
      mechanically ruptured during the milling and are not more than partially
      cooked during the aforementioned heating.
PAL  If the material is substantially dry, the milling and heating will not
      release substantial amounts of steam but if the material is moist, the
      heating of the material will convert at least some of the water to steam,
      assisting in the disintegration of the starch granules of the grain and
      possibly causing some cooking thereof.
PAL  External heat may be supplied to the apparatus, electrically, or by gas.

PAL  A destainer for electrophoresis slab gels. The slab gels are placed in
      flexible mesh, and rolled into cylindrical shapes and inserted into slab
      holding tubes. The slab holding tubes are placed in the flow path of a
      washing liquid which flows past the slab gels and then through a return
      flow path containing a filter for removing stain particles washed away
      from the slab gels. A magnetic stirring pump draws fluid through the
      filter forcing it through the slab holding tubes and into the return flow
      path thereby forming a continuous flow path for destaining slab gels
      contained entirely within a cylindrical outside container.

PAL  A reserve cell is described for providing electrochemical energy and which
      is capable of long shelf life in the reserve state. This cell comprises a
      combined prismatic electrode chamber overlayed with a compartment
      containing the electrolyte. The electrolyte is prevented from access to
      the electrode chamber, by a frangible sealing means. The reserve cell is
      designed to be rapidly actuated by a separable actuator means of which the
      reserve cell actuator means described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,484,297 is
      preferred. The electrolyte compartment is completely lined with an
      electrolyte impermeable lining forming the electrolyte container which is
      collapsible. Upon actuation the applied pressure forcibly expels the
      electrolyte from the electrolyte container into the electrode chamber.
      This cell is particularly adapted for use with high energy electromotive
      couples including those dependent on active anodic metals above hydrogen
      in the electrochemical series and particularly such metals as lithium,
      calcium, sodium and potassium.

PAL  This invention relates to batteries with improved shelf life. When a
      relatively high resistance element is connected across the terminals of a
      battery, the resulting low current drain inhibits the self discharge of
      the battery and thus improves the shelf life. The resistance element can
      be built into the battery or mounted externally. The invention also
      relates to a battery-operated article, such as a flashlight, having a high
      resistance load built into the article to contact the terminals of the
      battery to provide a low current drain when the article is not being used.

PAL  In apparatus powered by electric batteries (e.g.: a paging receiver) having
      a battery compartment including means to couple the battery in it with a
      battery charger, the negative (-) charging contact is located at a
      position nearer to one end of the battery compartment than to the opposite
      end. A rechargeable battery (e.g.: Ni Cad) has a band of its insulated
      cover removed at a corresponding position so that the negative charging
      contact can touch the underlying portion of the battery container, and
      through that connection the charging circuit can be closed. The charging
      circuit cannot be closed if the battery is inserted with its polarity
      reversed. When a non-rechargeable battery is installed the
      recharging-circuit contact mates with a part of the insulation cover of
      the battery and the charging circuit cannot be closed. In one disclosed
      embodiment of the invention, if either battery is installed with its
      polarity reversed, the energizing circuit from the battery to the radio
      apparatus will not close.

PAL  A lightweight catalyst body bearing a finely divided metal of the platinum
      group is encased in a porous PTFE shell which is impermeable to the
      electrolyte because of its hydrophobic surface properties. Several small
      bodies of this kind, each containing about 1 mg of palladium are inserted
      in each cell of a vehicle storage battery and float on the electrolyte
      surface. They not only recombine hydrogen and oxygen to water and return
      the water to the electrolyte efficiently, even at high ambient
      temperatures, but the efficiency of the catalyst is not reduced under
      conditions causing considerable generation of stibine. The core material
      on which the catalyst is provided, with or without an additional carrier,
      may be activated charcoal, hollow glass spheres, a porous ceramic or a
      synthetic resin foam. The porous hydrophobic shell may be sintered or
      unsintered or may be made of superimposed sintered and unsintered layers.

PAL  Thermocouple apparatus for attachment to a pilot gas burner. A thermocouple
      has a mounting portion. An adaptor is mounted thereon engageable with a
      pilot burner bracket. The adaptor and the thermocouple mounting portion
      are yieldably restrained against relatively sliding movement to permit
      adjustment of the thermocouple body relative to the burner flame. The
      thermocouple is readily removeable from the adaptor for replacement even
      where the flame-engaging portion of the thermocouple has expanded.

      substrate and wherein P++ conductivity connecting regions are formed by
      diffusion of impurity atoms into the substrate. The process is compatible
      with the known silicon gate process, enabling semiconductor devices of
      other types and with different thresholds to be formed on the substrate at

      particular use in the deep drawing of containers, such as beverage cans,
      and the like, said alloy containing a relatively high level of manganese
      ranging by weight from about 1.6 to 3 percent. The improvement is
      particularly apparent in the production of chill cast shapes (sheet metal
      stock), such as by the continuous casting of the alloy between a pair of
      water-cooled rolls.

PAL  Apparatus for conveying an elongated hot-rolled steel rod in off-set ring
      form on a conveyor through a series of cooling chambers. Each chamber
      comprises a stationary lower section and a removable cover section, the
      interior walls of each being heat reflective. Each chamber is also
      provided with tubes supported adjacent the interior walls and controlled
      in temperature by gas passing through said tubes, said gas being cold or
      hot, the hot gas being supplied from a plurality of separately controlled
      burners. The tubes differentially control the rate of heat radiation from
      the rod rings to compensate for the different rates of radiational heat
      loss emanating from the top and sides of the rod rings so as to cause the
      rod to cool uniformly. The side walls of the chamber are provided with
      adjustable apertures for the escape of radiant energy from the sides of
      the rod rings. Means are provided for controllably lifting the roof from
      its completely closed position to one in which the top of the lower
      section is entirely exposed. Means are also provided for blowing cooling
      air through the rings. The apparatus provides means for carrying out a
      process for controlling the loss of heat from the rod by applying radiant
      heat selectively to the rod, by reflection from the interior walls or by
      the heated or cooled tubes, or both, substantially in inverse proportion
      to the accumulated mass of the rod from side to side of the conveyor.

PAL  A method of making a semiconductor device is described in which
      opposite-type impurities are introduced into the same surface of a
      substrate in such manner that the region of impurities of the
      opposite-type to that of the substrate overlaps completely the other
      substrate surface region. Then an epitaxial layer is grown on the surface
      of the substrate. There is thus formed two buried layers of which the one
      with the same type conductivity of the substrate is completely separated
      and isolated from the latter by the buried layer of opposite-type
      conductivity. Methods are also described for the manufacture of
      complementary bipolar transistors, in which the pnp type is made by the
      above described method.

PAL  Improved blasting compositions are prepared by the addition of a solution
      of an oil-soluble organic acid in fuel oil to prilled ammonium nitrate,
      followed by the addition of water, in controlled amounts, and ammonia, as
      an aqueous solution or in gaseous form, and mixing the resultant mixture
      until the density of the final product exceeds the density of water.

PAL  The invention relates to the manufacture of arrays of light emitting diodes
      (L.E.D.'s) from a wafer consisting of an n-type epitaxial layer on an
      n.sup.+ substrate. The method includes the steps of forming p-type islands
      by diffusing a p-type dopant into the epitaxial layer of an n on n.sup.+
      wafer, establishing contact with all of the p-type islands by means of a
      first set of conductors, mounting the wafer on a transparent support with
      the first set of conductors adjacent the support, depositing a second set
      of conductors on the n.sup.+ substrate and etching both the substrate and
      the epitaxial layer from between the conductors of the second set, the two
      sets of conductors being orthogonal and each p-n junction formed by a
      p-type island and the epitaxial layer being in contact with one and only
      one conductor from each set.

PAL  In making a target for a television camera tube, it is necessary to thin
      the backside of a semiconductive substrate, which is opposite a face
      having a diode array thereon. To thin the substrate, it is positioned face
      down on a fluid nondeleterious to the substrate and diode array. The fluid
      is contained in a cavity of a holding device. The positioning is such that
      there is no space between the fluid and the substrate. An apertured top
      member is then mounted on the substrate and the holding device to retain
      the substrate on the fluid. The assembly of the holding device and top
      member with the substrate therebetween is immersed and rotated in an
      etchant to thin the backside of the substrate through the aperture of the
      top member. The fluid provides a tight seal on the face of the substrate
      to prevent the etchant from damaging such face and the diode array
      thereon. A vent extending from the cavity of the holding device to its
      outer edge assists in the subsequent removal of the substrate from the
      cavity.

      The tape is lap-wound over an electrical conductor which is then immersed

PAL  Disclosed is a method and apparatus for measuring stresses in a wire or
      wire cord, such as that found in the reinforcing belt of a pneumatic tire.
      A portion of the wire is encapsulated in a solder material which is
      machined such that a rectangular solid billet of the solder is formed
      thereon. A transducer or plurality of transducers in the form of strain
      gauges are fixed to at least one flat surface on the billet and oriented
      in a direction such that forces applied to the tire will affect the
      resistance of the transducer. The resistance of the transducer can be
      balanced in a bridge network and the voltage resulting therefrom suitably
      readout in terms of the stress being applied to the wire cord. The cord
      can be built into a tire with the lead wires from the transducer being fed
      through the tire to the bridge network. The stress tests can then be
      accomplished in an inflated and running tire.

PAL  This invention is an improvement in a process for making a thermosetting
      resin article.
PAL  In the process of producing an article of thermosetting resin which
      comprises (a) impregnating a sheet having an open-cell structure with a
      curable thermosetting resin, (b) applying a layer of fibrous reinforcing
      material to at least one side of the impregnated sheet, (c) compressing
      the sheet and reinforcing layer to the extent that resin is expelled from
      the sheet into the fibrous reinforcing layer and (d) allowing the resin in
      the sheet and layer to cure while maintaining the compression, the
      improvement which comprises uniformly incorporating a gas release agent
      into the curable thermosetting resin to promote the expulsion of resin
      from the sheet into the reinforcing layer.
PAL  The invention also includes an open-cell sheet impregnated with a mixture
      of a curable thermosetting resin, an effective curing agent for said
      resin, and a compatible gas release agent.

PAL  An improved method of finishing leather by transferring a finish coating,
      at least the outer stratum of which comprises a thermoplastic, adhesive
      acrylic polymer, from a release layer bearing the finish coating to the
      leather. The leather to be coated (which may be supported on an
      appropriate backing layer) and the release layer are pressed into a
      sandwich-like assembly with the concurrent application of sufficient heat
      and pressure to transfer substantially the entire finish coating to the
      surfaces of the leather and the backing layer juxtaposed therewith.
      Transfer of the finish coating is effected without the application of any
      adhesive material or "tie coat" prior to pressing the coating into contact
      with the leather, by virtue of the thermoplastic, adhesive characteristics
      of the acrylic finish coating per se.
PAL  The method may be carried out batch-wise employing discrete backing and
      release layers for the transfer of finish coatings to individual leather
      pieces. Alternatively, the method may be performed continuously with the
      successive feed of leathers to be coated between a transfer web providing
      the desired release layer and a supporting web imparting the requisite
      backing or support.

PAL  A process monitoring and control system is provided for use in a tire
      calendering system producing a strip of rubber tire material comprising a
      layer of tire cord laminated between first and second layers of rubber. In
      a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the first rubber layer is
      measured by a single point radiation backscatter gauge at a point prior to
      its lamination with the tire cord and second layer. The thickness of the
      first layer is controlled to a desired target by means of a control loop
      including the single point gauge. The total thickness of the combined
      layers is measured at the calender output by a total thickness gauge.
      Gauge coordination means, including a delay means, are provided whereby
      measurements of the thickness of the first layer and of the combined strip
      are derived over the same longitudinal portion of the strip. Means are
      included, responsive to the coordinated measurements, to control the
      thickness of the second layer to maintain the total thickness of the strip
      at a desired total thickness target, in such a way as to eliminate any
      error in the thickness of the first layer as a factor affecting the
      control of total thickness. In this manner, the desired total thickness of
      the calendered material and the desired position of the tire cord between
      the first and second rubber layers are maintained.

      temperature of 450.degree.-550.degree.F, extruding the molten resin onto a
      chill roll through a die which is set at an angle to the chill roll,
      employing sub-atmospheric pressure between the extruder die and the chill
      roll, rapidly cooling the extruded film on the chill roll to form a
      substantially amorphous nylon, and thereafter joining the nylon to a

PAL  Apparatus for forming the edges of mineral fiber blankets during their
      advance along a processing path. Guide means having surfaces shaped to
      continuously direct feathered or ragged longitudinal edges of an uncured
      mat of mineral fibers as it is introduced to forming apparatus causes a
      gathering of the fibers to control the uniformity of the density of the
      edge portion of the mass. The guide can comprise surfaces extending
      radially outward at the effective ends of a pressure roll cooperating with
      a rotatable mandrel in the formation of tubes of fiber mat. The first
      surface encountered by an advancing blanket raises the feathered edge. The
      raised edge is turned inward toward the major body portion of the blanket
      by a second surface. A third surface parallels the path of advance to
      establish the desired margin and maintain that margin as the blanket is
      compacted in its major face. Other surfaces can be provided to form or
      shape the marginal edges of the mass of mineral fibers to obtain a desired
      configuration, for example, square or chamfered edges.

PAL  An apparatus and method are disclosed for removing unreacted monomer and
      other volatile material from an aqueous dispersion of polymeric substance.
      An aqueous dispersion containing volatile material to be stripped is
      injected into a substantially unrestricted contacting tube along with a
      stripping gas such as steam to provide within the contacting tube a high
      velocity vaporous mixture of aqueous dispersion and stripping gas. The
      vaporous mixture is maintained under a pressure above atmospheric and
      preferably greater than 5 psi gauge within the contacting tube a time
      sufficient to permit absorption of volatiles from the dispersion to the
      stripping gas and preferably to permit saturation equilibrium to be
      approached. The vaporous mixture is discharged from the contacting tube
      through a nozzle into a substantially unrestricted post-contacting tube,
      which is maintained below atmospheric pressure, and preferably is impinged
      against a baffle means. Thereafter, the vaporous mixture is discharged
      from the post-contacting tube into a separator chamber that is maintained
      at a sufficient pressure below atmospheric to flash volatiles from the
      mixture. The volatiles and stripping gas are then removed from the
      separator chamber separate from the stripped aqueous dispersion. The
      stripping may be thereupon repeated to further reduce the residual
      volatiles within the aqueous dispersion.

PAL  Specifically disclosed is the combination of a paper making machine and a
      control system including an automatic arrangement which, on demand of the
      machine operator, performs a coordinated machine speed increase,
      maintaining the paper sheet characteristics substantially constant until
      the dryer steam pressure or the steam valve opening reaches a limit.
      During the speed increase, a number of other machine variables are
      compared with set limit values and the speed increase is discontinued when
      a limit is exceeded for a predetermined time period. When the steam
      pressure has been at a limit, or the steam valve has been wide open, for a
      predetermined time period the control system, upon sensing the limit being
      reached, switches to a dryer limited mode of operation wherein the steam
      pressure is maintained at the limit or the steam valve is locked open. The
      sheet moisture content is then controlled by a combination of automatic
      stock valve and machine speed adjustments, while basis weight is
      controlled by coordinated machine speed adjustments. The control system is
      adapted for universal use with many machine arrangements which may have
      separated and/or split dryer sections for rewet or coating operations and
      the like and/or curl control. To this end, the controller includes a
      system of logic which determines the optimum control procedure in each
      case.

PAL  An elongated web of paper is treated to render it especially suitable for
      being gathered transversely and wrapped to make cigarette filters. The
      treatment includes passing the web through the bight between a pair of
      rotating rolls provided with intermeshing ribs that do not contact one
      another and which are arranged generally in planes parallel to their axis
      of rotation so that the paper is stretched longitudinally in successive
      transverse areas whereby the paper fibers are loosened and exposed in such
      areas without complete destruction of the longitudinal continuity of the
      web. Thereafter the paper is passed through the bight between another pair
      of rolls provided with narrowly-spaced circumferential intermeshing ribs
      which do not contact one another and are arranged generally in planes
      normal to the axis of the rolls so that the paper is grooved parallel to
      the travel of the web and stretched transversely of these grooves to
      loosen and expose the fibers even more without destroying the transverse
      continuity of the web.

PAL  In a nuclear reactor of the BWR type having finger control rods mounted in
      guide tubes and having a member movable upwardly to push the control rods
      into the guide tubes, the control rods are connected to this member by a
      joint such as a bayonet joint releasable by turning of the control rods
      about their longitudinal axis. On the upper ends of each control rod is
      slidably mounted a sleeve which is spring-pressed downwardly. This sleeve
      is non-rotatable with respect to the control rod. The sleeve has either a
      square lower end slidable within a square tube or has projections at its
      lower end in a round tube having ribs running longitudinally thereof. The
      arrangement is such that when the support is in its uppermost position the
      control rods project above the fuel assembly and the sleeve can be raised
      against the spring action out of the upper ends of the tubes so as to
      permit turning of the rods to release them for removal.

PAL  A gas-coolant nuclear breeder reactor includes a core enclosed by a
      pressure vessel having a bottom beneath the core potentially capable of
      burning through if the core melts due to excessive operating temperatures.
      A basin is positioned beneath the core, either outside or inside of the
      pressure vessel, to intercept the melted core. The heat of the melted core
      must be dissipated rapidly because the reactor is enclosed by a steel
      containment vessel which might be unable to resist the internal pressure
      that would otherwise result from the heat. Therefore, means are provided
      for conducting a fluid coolant cooling the metal core, in the basin, from
      the latter to an extended area of the inside of the steel containment
      vessel which, being of relatively high heat conductivity, conducts the
      heat from the coolant to the atmosphere outside of the containment vessel.
      Cooling water may be sprayed on the outside of this containment vessel to
      assist in the dissipation of the heat. Arrangements are provided for
      increasing the efficiency of the heat transfer from the melted core to the
      fluid coolant.

PAL  A method for the genetic detection of specific microorganisms based on the
      phenomenon of transformation is disclosed. Variants such as auxotrophs
      which are distinguishable from their wild, parent strain are transformed
      by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from microorganism cells present
      in a biological test sample. The detection of transformed cells indicates
      the presence of the specific microorganism under determination in the
      sample. The transforming-DNA is in a sterile, crude form, thereby
      providing a simple, rapid, and highly specific test method.

PAL  A continuous method and apparatus for the determination of urea in a
      biological fluid such as blood, for example, is disclosed. In a
      continuously flowing system, the biological sample is introduced into a
      buffered carrier solution of low electrical conductance and is caused to
      flow into a chamber containing an immobilized enzyme which catalyzes a
      specific reaction which changes the electrical properties of the solution
      by increasing the dissociated ion concentration therein. This increase in
      dissociated ion concentration is directly proportional to the original
      concentration of urea in the biological sample; and any one of the several
      conventional electrical measurements may be made to determine the increase
      in such concentration or the rate of increase in such concentration and
      thereby determine the concentration of urea in the original biological
      sample. The buffered carrier solution containing the products of the
      enzyme-catalyzed reaction is reclaimed by circulating it through a
      deionization, purification stage in which the solution conductivity is
      substantially returned to the prereaction value. The carrier solution is
      recirculated and used for processing additional samples. The enzyme,
      urease, is immobilized in a manner which allows many tests to be run
      without any significant loss thereof. The savings in enzyme requirements
      and the savings accomplished by recirculating the buffered carrier
      solution greatly reduces the cost of analysis.

PAL  Desalination apparatus with the double feature of condensation and
      evaporation, comprising plural dish-like condensing elements piled
      coaxially, wherein a sloped bottom diaphragm is provided in each element,
      at the lower part of each of which an upwardly diverging duct is provided.
      A cooling pipe is led through the ducts of the elements. A depending pipe
      is provided near the outer edge of each element, through which the
      supplied sea water flows from an upper element to a successive lower
      element. The lowest condensing element is heated or is filled up with
      water that is hotter than the supplied sea water. The distilled water
      obtained on each condensing element is withdrawn from the lower edges of
      the ducts as a result of evaporation from the elements and subsequent
      condensation on the undersides of the diaphragms.

      incorporating an expansion chamber with an air inlet over a distilled
      water accumulating tank so that condensing steam and water condensate may
      mix with air to improve the potable quality of the distilled water before
      it drains into the accumulator tank. The evaporator of a refrigeration
      system used to cool the distilled water is located inside of the distilled
      water accumulator tank as is the steam condenser coil, so that the
      combined cooling effect of the refrigerant evaporator and the chilled

PAL  An evaporator-condenser unit is disclosed which includes an elongated
      enclosed chamber into which hot gases are injected to form a cyclonic
      stream therein. The hot gases impinge and pass around a substantial
      plurality of tubes containing relatively cool sanitary liquid waste.
      Condensation thereby forms on the tubes and is blown by the cyclonic
      action of the hot gas stream to the outer periphery of the cyclonic
      chamber where the condensation is collected and conveyed away from the
      chamber. At the same time, the heat from the hot gases is transferred to
      the liquid sanitary waste which is converted into steam in a steam
      expansion chest at the top of the cyclonic chamber. The steam is
      compressed and injected back into the hot gas stream flowing into the
      cyclonic chamber. The steam is then condensed on the tubes and conveyed
      away for appropriate utilization.
PAL  Clogging of the tubes by solid matter contained within the liquid waste is
      prevented by means of a periodic blow down operation which forces the
      material in each of the tubes under high pressure into the steam expansion
      chest. The steam expansion chest includes a sump which collects the liquid
      and solid waste and conveys same away from the evaporator-condenser unit.
      The cooled gases after passing through and about the plurality of tubes is
      conducted away from the cyclonic chamber to a discharge stack.

PAL  The present invention relates to additives for electroplating baths used
      for the electrodeposition of zinc-copper alloys, and particularly to such
      alloys designed to be used as undercoats for subsequently applied metal
      coatings. The improvement comprises additives for incorporation into
      conventional zinc-copper electrolytes, comprising a mixture of a buffering
      agent selected from the group consisting of boric acid, alkali metal
      borates, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal phosphates and glycine, a
      metal ion selected from the group consisting of nickel ion and cobalt ion,
      and ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (as the alkali metal salt).

PAL  A method of forming a colored oxide film on the surface of an aluminum
      material is disclosed in which the aluminum material is subjected to an
      electrolytic treatment in an aqueous solution containing sulfuric acid to
      form an aluminum oxide film containing aluminous oxides and having lattice
      defects; sulfuric ions in the solution are caused to enter into the
      lattice defects of the oxide film; some or all of the sulfuric ions are
      reduced to form sulfur and sulfides; and the colored oxide film is formed
      using the sulfur and sulfides as coloring sources.

PAL  A process for the production of metals by the electrolysis of metal
      compounds dissolved in a molten electrolyte, in particular for the
      production of aluminum from aluminum oxide. The electric power is passed
      through a multi-cell furnace with at least one inconsumable bi-polar
      electrode, made of electrode materials which are compatible with one
      another. The anions, in particular, the oxygen ions of the dissolved metal
      compounds have their charges removed on the surface of the electron
      conductive ceramic oxide anode and the metal ions, in particular the
      aluminum ions on the surface of the cathode which is made of another
      material than that used for the anode surface.

      the plate to flatten it and excess buffer solution is removed. Wicks are
      placed at opposite edges of the membrane and extend into the buffer
      reservoirs. Multiple samples are applied to the membrane and are
      electrophoresed. Several membranes may be placed across the plate with
      interconnecting wicks for series electrophoresis. Or several membranes may
      be superposed on the plate with diffusion sample to the lowermost plate
      for parallel electrophoresis.
PAL  The invention also provides a system for rapid and accurate placement of
      samples to be tested on the membrane.

PAL  This invention provides a process for selectively removing metal values
      from ocean floor nodule ore by a two-stage procedure. In the first stage,
      the ore is leached with an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid or a hydrogen
      halide to preferentially remove nickel and copper. In the second stage,
      the ore is leached with a reducing agent to preferentially remove cobalt
      and manganese. The two leach solutions can then be further treated to
      separate the individual metal values, e.g., by liquid ion exchange
      procedures.

PAL  Copper is sputtered onto a substrate to make a solder-fast contact layer by
      carrying out the sputtering in a discharge of a monatomic gas containing
      0.5 to 16% of air, nitrogen or oxygen which reduces the conductivity of
      the copper layer, but makes it resistant to alloying with a solution in
      solder, to an extent comparable with the results obtained by the provision
      of intermediate diffusion barrier layers. Best results are obtained in an
      argon discharge in the presence of an admixture of nitrogen or air between
      2 and 4% by volume. The solder-wetting properties are not impaired.

      referring to the electrolytic cells which enable the novel circuit to be
      designed to operate at high current capacities upward to about 500,000
      amperes while maintaining high operating efficiencies. These high current
      capacities provide for high production capacities which result in high
      production rates for given cell room floor areas and reduce capital

PAL  A process for the manufacture of a porous diaphragm of a synthetic
      material, especially polytetrafluoroethylene, which comprises forming a
      sheet of the synthetic material in admixture with a solid particulate
      additive (eg starch) to be removed therefrom, introducing said sheet into
      a cell, and removing the solid particulate additive from the sheet by
      treating the sheet in situ in the cell with an acid (eg hydrochloric acid)
      containing a corrosion inhibitor (eg propargyl alcohol). The porous
      diaphragms are especially suitable for use in diaphragm cells for the
      production of chlorine from sodium chloride brine.

PAL  Polarizable particulate material, such as organic and inorganic colloidal
      particles such as small pieces of metal, oxides and the like, zwitterionic
      molecules, and even living organisms and viruses can be preferentially
      removed from a liquid by dielectrophoresis, by passing the liquid
      containing the polarizable particulate material to be removed over a
      ferroelectric apparatus which generates a periodic non-uniform electric
      field near the boundary between alternately polarized portions of the
      ferroelectric material. The periodic non-uniform electric field is
      generated by subjecting portions of the ferroelectric material to an
      alternating potential to alternately polarize the portions, while allowing
      other portions of the ferroelectric material to remain polarized in the
      same direction.

PAL  A heavy hydrocarbon feedstock is upgraded by at least one of the processes
      of desulfurization, decreasing carbon residues, increasing API gravity,
      and liquefaction of solid feedstock by reacting the feedstock at elevated
      temperature and pressure in the presence of carbon monoxide and in the
      presence of a catalytically active metal. In one embodiment the active
      metallic catalyst is associated with minor amounts of alkali or alkaline
      earth metals to minimize promotion of cracking side reactions. In a
      preferred embodiment a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock is upgraded in the
      presence of the catalyst system formed from a barium salt which has been
      deposited on cobalt molybdate dispersed on an alumina support.

PAL  An improved combination process for the production of an unleaded, narrow
      boiling range, high octane motor fuel which involves (1) a novel form of
      low-severity hydrocracking followed by (2) catalytic reforming wherein the
      exothermic conversion in the hydrocracking zone is controlled by adjusting
      the hydrocracking reaction zone pressure. The process is effected without
      the intermediate separation of the product effluent from the low-severity
      hydrocracking zone, and therefore, provides a true "in-line"
      hydrocracking/reforming combination process.

      oxide, wherein at least 50 weight percent of said inorganic oxide is
      silica and/or alumina, said matrix having dispersed therein a particulate
      crystalline aluminosilicate carrying rare earth cations, said composite
      catalyst having rare earth impregnated therein in an amount of from about
      1 to 6 percent by weight (expressed as RE.sub.2 O.sub.3), this amount
      being over and above the rare earth level attainable by ion exchange
      alone. impregnated rare earth may be incorporated into the catalyst by
      impregnating the composite with a rare earth-containing solution and then
      removing excess solution and drying, by impregnating the matrix with rare
      earth and then admixing the matrix with rare earth-exchanged crystalline

PAL  The invention relates to a process for separating mixtures of hydrocarbons,
      notably conjugated diene hydrocarbons or aromatic hydrocarbons, from
      mixtures containing the same, by the general technique of permeation or
      pervaporation through specific membranes.
PAL  The specific membranes used are formed of a high polymer comprising
      functional groups chemically combined by covalent bonding within the
      polymer forming the said membrane, the said groups possessing a
      physicochemical affinity, notably a capacity to complex, with respect to
      one of said hydrocarbons and, substantially, the absence of such a
      capacity with respect to other hydrocarbons of the mixture. For the
      separation of dienes, such as butadiene and pentadiene, membranes are used
      containing active nitrile, pyrrolidone, N-substituted groups, such as
      N-alkyl groups, preferably N-vinyl or N-methyl-pyrrolidone. The membrane
      can be obtained, for example, by copolymerization of butadiene with
      acrylonitrile, with the membrane containing about 2.5% to 30% of active
      nitrile groups and preferably from 15% to 20%.

PAL  A meat processing system and method wherein trim pieces of meat having lean
      meat portions and fat meat portions are divided into smaller regular sized
      meat chunks of higher lean meat content and chunks of higher fat content.
      The chunks are passed seriatim through a photometric sensing zone to
      photometrically detect an optical property related to the lean meat or fat
      content of the meat chunks and the meat chunks are thereafter sorted in
      accordance with the value of the optical property sensed in the
      photometric sensing zone. Meat chunks of higher lean meat content are
      thereby sorted from chunks of higher fat content. The temperature of the
      meat chunks is maintained at or near the freezing temperature to
      facilitate singularizing and handling of the meat chunks so that the meat
      chunks can be passed seriatim through the photometric sensing zone.

PAL  The specific information storage and retrieval system described herein
      stores 49,000 microfiches in a central file, any one of which may be
      viewed in a matter of seconds. More specifically, the central file uses an
      arrangement of 20 shelves mounted on a closed loop track, each holding
      2,450 microfiches, each microfiche in turn having 50 or 60 separate
      images. When a particular microfiche is selected, the proper shelf is
      rotated into a predetermined position. Concurrently a viewing station
      including a transducer such as a film camera or a television camera is
      brought adjacent to the selected microfiche which is partially extracted
      from its storage location so as to be viewed by the transducer.

PAL  In a system for classifying objects, particularly fruits, which pass
      successively through an inspection station for evaluation according to
      respective grades and for generating evaluation signals corresponding to
      such grades. The inspected fruits are then delivered to a distribution
      apparatus by means of a sorting conveyor having a single row of traveling
      holders for the individual fruits. The sorting conveyor has a plurality of
      discharge stations corresponding to the different evaluation grades and,
      when a holder carrying a fruit reaches a discharge station that
      corresponds to the evaluation grade for that particular fruit, the
      generated evaluation signal for that particular fruit causes the holder to
      discharge the fruit.

PAL  Method and apparatus for automatically popping corn in heated seasoning
      oil. A rotary valve disk in a closed pot is operated to correlate the
      phases of corn and salt input into the pot, cooking, steam discharge, and
      discharge of popped corn and unpopped kernels by means of an air current.
      A deflector plate directs the air into a path for optimum corn evacuation
      through a downwardly facing outlet. The air current sweeps the corn and
      kernels through the outlet and along a curved path whereby the corn and
      kernels are separated from the air current. Thereafter the air current is
      recirculated into the pot. "Old maids" in the discharge of popped corn
      from the pot are trapped and separated therefrom for removal through a
      chute in one form, or through a screen in the bottom of the display case
      in another form.

PAL  Insoluble gases, liquid and solid materials present as the disperse phase
      in a heterogeneous dispersion are removed by contacting such dispersion
      with one side of a membrane in which the disperse phase is soluble and on

      membrane with a material which does not permeate or react with the
      membrane but which reacts with the disperse phase passing through the
      membrane. The reaction product is such that it does not permeate the
      membrane. In this manner the driving force for passage through the
      membrane by the disperse phase is maximized.

PAL  A method for removing antimicrobials such as pentachlorophenol from waste
      water by liquid-liquid extraction with a water immiscible organic liquid
      in a packed column; recovering the antimicrobial from the organic phase by
      distillation if desired; and, treating of the aqueous phase to remove
      residual antimicrobial and organic liquid. The process of the present
      invention recovers about 99 percent of the antimicrobial pentachlorophenol
      in the waste water producing a waste water containing less than 30 ppm
      pentachlorophenol and less than about 2 percent organic liquid, both of
      which may be removed by conventional carbon absorption or soil percolation
      to acceptable ecological levels for introduction into a stream or reuse as
      process water.

PAL  At least one iron salt and a sodium hydroxide solution are added to an
      emulsion of oil in water to adjust a pH value of 5.5 to 6.5. An intimate
      mixture is formed as said steps are performed. The mixture is left until a
      layer of iron hydroxide having a high oil content has creamed. When said
      flotation has resulted in a separation of phases, the oilfree water is
      withdrawn first and the oil-containing sludge is withdrawn thereafter.

      closure is formed of a self-sealing elastomeric material which is
      penetrable by a pointed hollow needle through which the blood to be
      separated is conducted into the container. A piston is slidably disposed
      in the container with its outer surfaces in sealing contact with the inner
      surfaces of the container. Centrifugally actuated valve means is provided
      on the piston which is normally closed and automatically opens in response
      to centrifugal force. When blood in the container is subjected to
      centrifugal force it first separates into its light phase and heavy phase.
      Thereafter the piston with open valve moves down through the light phase
      while retaining sealing engagement with the inner surfaces of the
      container. Positive stop means is provided on the container between its
      ends so that the piston as it moves through the light phase will contact
      the stop means and stop at a predetermined distance above the bottom of
      the tube. Then the valve means automatically closes to provide an
      impervious barrier between the separated light and heavy phases of the
      blood.

PAL  In a filter plate-and-diaphragm assembly, the marginal sealing zone of the
      diaphragm has a sealing rib received in a groove of the filter plate
      frame. During operation, the diaphragm, with the exception of the sealing
      zone, is lifted off the filter plate by a pressure medium introduced in a
      pressure chamber bounded by the diaphragm. The rib is situated in the
      vicinity of that edge of the sealing zone that is remote from the pressure
      chamber, so that an intermediate sealing zone of considerable width is
      disposed between the rib and the pressure chamber.

PAL  A casing preferably formed of sheet metal deep drawn and seamless has an
      outlet at its bottom and an inlet in its cylindrical side wall below its
      open top a portion of which is circumferentially indented providing an
      inwardly projecting shoulder below said inlet, and a cover is removably
      clamped on said open top of the casing and has an extension engaging and
      holding a circumferential projection on a filter element in liquid-tight
      contact with said shoulder. The extension has perforations providing for
      passing of liquid from said inlet into said filter element, and may have
      an imperforate portion to extend into the liquid in said casing below said
      circumferential shoulder when the cover is closed during filtering
      operations so the liquid level will drop below the upper end of the filter
      element when the cover is removed and thus prevent spilling of the liquid.

PAL  A self-cleaning fluid filter for filtering fluid entering an inlet of a
      pump, such as an air pump, in which a fluid filter is wrapped around a
      filter spool forming a filter drum and the drum coupled to the shaft of
      the pump motor for rotation thereof. The fluid entering the rotating
      filter will then be filtered of its impurities which, due to centrifugal
      force, will be dispersed outwardly from the filter drum to drop into a
      residue container. A deflector plate is disposed in proximity to the inlet
      for deflecting heavy particles to the residue container.

PAL  A lubricant for high temperature metal forging applications comprises a
      water soluble inorganic salt whose melting point is below the metal
      working temperature, in admixture with an inorganic salt which decomposes
      to a gas at temperature below the metal working temperature, and one or
      more particulate lubricants. The low melting point inorganic salt is
      sodium nitrite and the decomposible salt is sodium bicarbonate. The
      particulate lubricant material may be graphite and/or zinc oxide pigment
      powder. Water may be added to the mixture and, in such case, surfactants
      and thickening agents are added to the formulation. Minor amounts of other
      ingredients such as an anti-oxidant, may also be added to the water-based
      embodiments.

PAL  The instant invention relates to a process for controlling the viscosity of
      organic liquids by incorporating in said liquid a minor amount of an ionic
      polymer, and a cosolvent for the ionic groups of said polymer. The ionic
      polymer comprises a backbone which is substantially soluble in said
      organic liquid, and pendant ionic groups which are substantially insoluble
      in said organic liquid. A cosolvent is selected which will solubilize the
      pendant ionomeric groups and provide a reasonably homogeneous mixture of
      solvent, cosolvent and ionomeric polymer. The preferred compositions
      prepared by the method of the instant invention comprise an organic liquid
      having a solubility parameter of from 6 to 10.5 in combination with a
      sulfonated polymer containing from 0.2 up to 10.0 mole % ionic groups
      which has been neutralized by a basic material selected from Groups IA and
      IIA, IB and IIB of the Periodic Table of the Elements (and also lead, tin
      and antimony) and a nonvolatile alcohol or amine cosolvent. In a most
      preferred embodiment, the solvent is a high boiling paraffinic type oil,
      the polymer is a sulfonated noncrystalline olefin copolymer, comprising
      from 0.3 to 3.0 weight percent sodium or potassium sulfonate groups, and a
      C.sub.6 to C.sub.12 alcohol, or C.sub.2 --C.sub.12 glycol, or C.sub.3
      -C.sub.12 triol is used as the cosolvent.

PAL  Cellulose material having improved resistance to thermal deterioration and
      having particular application as insulation material for electrical
      apparatus. The cellulose material is treated with an aqueous dispersion of
      a liquid, uncured, crosslinkable thermosetting resin, such as an epoxy
      resin, and a water soluble, nitrogen-containing compound. During curing of
      the resin, the cellulose molecules are believed to enter into the
      crosslinking reaction to provide a treated cellulosic product capable of
      withstanding the deteriorating action of heat over extended periods of
      time. A protein material, such as casein or isolated soy protein, can be
      added to the treating liquid and the protein not only contributes
      additional nitrogen groups to the treating media to further increase the
      thermal stability of the cellulose, but also acts as a film former. The
      thermal stability of the cellulose material can be further improved by the
      addition of an organic amine, such as melamine, to the treating liquid.

PAL  A novel antifreeze composition is provided which comprises a water soluble
      liquid alcohol freezing point depressant and an inhibitor. The freezing
      point depressant is preferably at least one water soluble alcohol
      containing from one to four carbon atoms inclusive and from one to four
      hydroxy groups inclusive such as ethylene glycol. The inhibitor comprises
      at least one substance selected from the group consisting of
PA1  A. compounds corresponding to the following structural formula:
      ##SPC1##
PAL  Wherein R.sub.1 is an alkylene radical containing from zero to 12 carbon
      atoms inclusive, R.sub.2 is an alkyl radical containing from one to 10
      carbon atoms inclusive and R.sub.3 is an alkylene radical containing from
      one to 12 carbon atoms inclusive, and
PA1  B. the mono- and di-metal salts, the mono- and di-ammonium salts, and the
      mono- and di-amides of compounds corresponding to the above structural
      formula. The presently preferred inhibitor comprises
      1-carboxy-2-hexyl-5-(7-carboxyheptyl)-cyclohex-3-ene, or the mono- and
      di-metal salts, ammonium salts, and amides thereof. The inhibitor also
      aids in solublizing antifoam agents. The invention further provides a
      process for inhibiting the corrosion of solder alloys which employs the
      novel antifreeze composition of the invention.

PAL  Improved surface active compositions are provided which contain a surface
      active agent and a catalytically effective amount of a novel catalyst. The
      catalyst is prepared by steps including admixing a water soluble alkali
      metal silicate with an aqueous medium containing carefully controlled
      amounts of dissolved water soluble substances which are sources of calcium
      ion and magnesium ion, reacting the same to produce an aqueous colloidal
      suspension of the reaction product, admixing a micelle-forming surfactant
      with the aqueous medium, and agitating the aqueous medium containing the
      colloidal particles and surfactant to form catalyst-containing micelles.
      The improved surface active compositions are especially useful as laundry
      detergents, dish washing detergents, and general household and industrial
      cleansers.

PAL  A solid composition capable of self-sustained combustion to produce gaseous
      nitrogen and nonvolatile solids as its combustion products comprises a
      mixture of a first metal azide and the oxide or salt of a second metal
      which second metal is below the first metal in the electrochemical series
      and which is capable of being substituted by the first metal in the oxide
      or salt. Many combinations of various components may be used, but some
      care is required to select only those combinations in which the solid
      products are nonvolatile at the temperatures encountered during the
      combustion. A representative system employes iron oxide and sodium azide
      according to the following reactions:
EQU  Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3 +6NaN.sub.3 .fwdarw.2Fe+3Na.sub.2 O+9N.sub.2 .uparw.
PAL  Another embodiment of the invention generates mixtures of nitrogen and
      other gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and/or water
      particularly suitable for use in lasers. This is accomplished by adding to
      the mixture materials which react or decompose into the desired gases. If
      carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide is the desired additional gas, a metal
      carbonate may be used as the salt in the above reaction.

PAL  This application is directed to a method for regenerating catalyst values
      used in the synthesis of a diol; the synthesis consists of a hydroperoxide
      reaction with an olefin in the presence of water and a molybdenum
      catalyst; the regenerating process consists in treating the molybdenum
      catalyst residue (or a fraction thereof) with ammonia -- optionally after
      calcining -- and causing a diol to act on the ammonium molybdate so
      obtained; in one embodiment ammonia in gaseous form is passed in contact
      with a catalyst residue (not previously calcined) which is in solution;
      the reaction products in the synthesis of the diol are a hydroperoxide
      such as tertiary hydroperoxide of isopentane and an olefin such as methyl
      2-butene; the diol synthesized in 2-methyl 2,3-butanediol; it is also the
      synthesized diol which is preferably reacted with the ammonium molybdate.

PAL  A catalytic composite, comprising a combination of a nickel component and a
      tungsten component with a silica-alumina carrier material wherein said
      carrier material is co-gelled silica-alumina consisting of from about 43
      percent to about 57 percent by weight of alumina and from about 57 percent
      to 43 percent by weight silica and wherein said components are present in
      amounts sufficient to result in the composite containing, on an elemental
      basis, about 2 to about 10 percent by weight of the nickel component and
      about 8 to about 20 percent by weight of the tungsten component, is
      disclosed. Key features of the subject composite are the criticality of
      the alumina content of the carrier material and the facility of using a
      co-gelled silica-alumina carrier material. The principal utility of the
      subject composite is in the hydrocracking of hydrocarbons. A specific
      example of the catalyst disclosed is a combination of nickel and tungsten
      with a co-gelled silica-alumina carrier material containing 50 weight
      percent alumina in amounts sufficient to result in the composite
      containing, on an elemental basis, about 7 to about 9 weight percent
      nickel and about 17 to about 19 weight percent tungsten.

      cent by weight), of aluminium (50 per cent by weight), of magnesium (14
      per cent by weight), of calcium (10 per cent by weight) and of barium (1
      per cent by weight), and the method of preparing it consists in that
      nickel carbonate, oxide or hydroxide of aluminium, and magnesium oxide
      pre-calcined at a temperature of 1300.degree..+-.50.degree.C, are mixed
      with an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate and of barium oxide; the
      obtained mixture is dried and calcined, and to the obtained mixture of the
      metal oxides are added a binding agent (calcium aluminate), a lubricating
      agent (potassium stearate), and a wetting agent (water or an aqueous
      solution of sulphosalicylic acid or of triethanolamine); the prepared
      mixture is pressed into tablets and the latter are hardened hydraulically,
      dried and calcined.

PAL  A normally hydrophilic microporous material having a polymeric matrix and a
      filler dispersed throughout the matrix wherein the filler contains active
      polar groups, is rendered hydrophobic by exposing the material to a
      reactive compound. In one preferred embodiment of the invention the
      reactive compound is a silane or a silazane whereas in another preferred
      embodiment the reactive compound is a Werner-type complex of fatty acids
      coordinated with a metal. The treated microporous material is rendered
      impervious to water-based liquids but remains pervious with respect to
      vapors or gases.

PAL  Improved lignocellulosic particleboard, hardboard, and plywood are produced
      using a lignin sulfonate-phenol formaldehyde glue system. Preferred
      products are secured by using Douglas fir chips in combination with a
      unique technique of blending the lignin sulfonate with a phenol and
      formaldehyde. A specific technique is to react lignin sulfonate with
      formaldehyde under influence of caustic and heat and then to react the
      resulting compound with phenol formaldehyde resin to secure a more
      effective final glue system.

PAL  Disclosed herein are high nitrile polymers which have been compounded with
      a modifier which is a combination of (1) a C.sub.12 to C.sub.28 saturated
      aliphatic fatty acid ester of glycerol or sorbitan and (2) a
      polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester. The amount of modifier used is in the
      range of from 0.01 to 1.0 percent by weight based on the weight of the
      nitrile polymer. The compounded polymers exhibit lower melt viscosity and
      increased melt flow. The modifiers also provide improved clarity, gloss
      and, in certain instances, articles molded from the compounded nitrile
      polymer exhibit lower residual monomer levels.

PAL  Colloidally dispersible microcrystalline polyesters are prepared by a
      hydrolytic removal of amorphous regions in synthetic, linear polyesters
      followed by a mechanical disintegration of the resulting aggregated
      microcrystals to produce discrete microcrystalline particles at least 5%
      by weight having a particle size not exceeding 1 micron. The
      microcrystalline polyesters exhibit a sharp X-ray diffraction pattern and
      distinctly modified thermal behavior as compared to the parent or
      precursor polyester resin.

      belts used to feed and transport paper in xerographic machines and paper
      sorting machines. The low-sulfur vulcanizate of isoprene provides high
      resistance to physical degradation due to dynamic mechanical stress under

PAL  Finely-divided dispersed solids are prepared by polymerizing in the
      presence of a free radical catalyst and an organic solvent a major amount
      of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or mixture of monomers and a minor
      amount of a hydroxy-terminated organic compound having from one to eight
      hydroxyl groups, an equivalent weight of from 500 to 10,000 and containing
      a polymerizable carbon-to-carbon double bond. The resulting polymeric
      solids are particularly useful in the preparation of reinforced polymer
      compositions.

PAL  The invention relates to poly(arylacetylene) thermosetting compositions and
      thermoset resins prepared therefrom. The thermosetting compositions
      comprise a polyacetylenically unsaturated prepolymer and a phenol-aldehyde
      resin. The prepolymer is a polymer of at least one polyacetylenically
      substituted aromatic compound, such as diethynylbenzene, and has a number
      average molecular weight of about 900 to about 12,000 and contains about 5
      to about 20% by weight of terminal acetylenic groups. Typical
      phenol-aldehyde resins are the resoles and novolacs.

PAL  Flameproof moulding compositions, which are based on polyolefins and made
      from a pulverulent blend comprising a polyolefin as its essential
      ingredient and a plurality of flame-retardant ingredients. The
      flame-retardant ingredients comprise red phosphorus and at least one
      organic nitrogen compound which carbonizes after inflammation. The
      moulding compositions contain the flame-retardant ingredients in a total
      proportion of at most about 30 weight %. Red phosphorus and organic
      nitrogen compound are used in a quantitative ratio between 99:1 and 1.99.

PAL  Wherein R is an alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms and X is hydrogen or --OR, are
      useful, in combination with hindered-phenol antioxidants, for inhibiting
      thermal degradation of polyolefins, especially polypropylene, in contact
      with copper as metal, alloys, oxides, or salts. Such compounds can be
      prepared by reacting hydrazine with a naphthoic acid ester which may have
      an alkoxy group in the 3- position to form an intermediate which reacts
      with 3-alkoxy-2-naphthoyl chloride to form said compounds.

PAL  The in situ thermal decomposition of specified furoxans to yield dinitrile
      oxides is used to modify a polyfunctional species. Preferred uses involve
      cross-linking of polymers, especially rubbers, but the process may also be
      used to form polymers from monomeric materials or to bind additives to
      polymeric substrates. Compositions incorporating polymeric materials and
      suitable furoxans may be used as "one-shot" casting systems or be produced
      in the form of thermally curable sheets, etc, having useful shelf-lives.

PAL  Soluble, hydrophilic polymers suitable for medical use and as blood plasma
      substitutes comprising low molecular weight polymer derived from at least
      one monomer of an acrylamide type material or a mono-ester of an acrylic
      type acid and a glycol which is condensed with bifunctional compounds to
      form a condensation polymer having increased molecular weight and
      enzymatically cleavable cross-links. The hydrophilic polymer is produced
      by polymerizing the acrylamide type material or monoester mentioned above
      to form a low molecular weight polymer which is then condensed with a
      bifunctional compound to form a high molecular weight condensation polymer
      having enzymatically cleavable cross-links.

PAL  An improved process for the treatment of pellets of a partially crystalline
      polymer to aid in the removal of volatile impurities from the polymer
      pellets is disclosed. The improvement comprises the step of contacting the
      polymer with water at a temperature at least as high as the boiling point
      of the solvent used in the polymerization process, the temperature being
      between the boiling point and the temperature at which the pellets of
      polymer agglomerate. In preferred embodiments the polymer is an ethylene
      polymer, e.g., an ethylene homopolymer or copolymer of ethylene and a
      higher .alpha.-olefin (e.g. butene-1), and the process is conducted as a
      continuous process at temperatures between 115.degree. and 125.degree.C.

PAL  In a suspension polymerization process which comprises polymerizing an
      ethylene halide by itself or a mixture of an ethylene halide and a monomer
      copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium in the presence of a
      suspending agent and an oil-soluble catalyst under pressure, a pressure
      polymerization vessel the internal exposed surfaces of which are wholly or
      at least partially lined with wood is used so as to prevent adhesion of
      the resulting polymer to the exposed area.
PAC  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
PAR  The present invention relates to a suspension polymerization process in
      which an ethylene halide or a mixture of an ethylene halide and a monomer
      copolymerizable therewith is continuously suspension polymerized while
      adherence of the polymerization component to the wall of the
      polymerization apparatus is prevented and to a polymerization apparatus
      therefor.
PAR  That is, as is well known, in the suspension polymerization of at least one
      monomer selected from ethylene halides including vinyl chloride, vinyl
      fluoride, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene,
      or mixtures thereof or mixtures of an ethylene halide and a monomer
      copolymerizable therewith in an aqueous medium in the presence of an
      oil-soluble catalyst and a suspending agent, the resulting polymer adheres
      to the inner wall of the polymerizatiton vessel and to the internal
      accessory devices such as agitating vanes, baffle plates, a temperature
      detector, and the like. This adhesion of the polymer reduces the yield of
      the polymer and a polymerization temperature adjusting ability and gives
      rise to problems such as difficulty in adjusting the polymerization
      temperature and mixing of the adhering material into the product thereby
      to cause deterioration of the physical properties of the product.
PAR  Further, there is caused another problem from the standpoint of operation
      of a polymerization vessel in that removal of the adhering material
      requires an excessive amount of labor and time, reducing the rate of
      production. In addition, occurrence and growth of the adhering material is
      a great obstacle to continuation of the suspension polymerization
      operation.
PAR  That is, in order to insure good quality of the product produced by a
      continuous suspension polymerization process, it is necessary to use a
      so-called multi-vessel type reactor so as to reduce reverse mixing as much
      as possible. For this purpose, a passage of a very small area must be
      formed at least between adjacent vessels, which in turn gives rise to the
      problem of plugging, whereby normal operation is hindered.
PAR  It is known that the occurrence of the sticking material depends upon the
      material from which the polymerization vessel used is made and the content
      contained in the polymerization vessel. In general, with a polymerization
      vessel made of stainless steel severe sticking occurs. In the case of a
      polymerization vessel lined with glass, the degree of sticking is slightly
      reduced, but when this type of vessel is used, the polymerization vessel
      must be cleaned after every polymerization operation and, thus, operated
      by a batch operation. It is not suitable for a continuous operation.
      Although various attempts have been long made to prevent such sticking, a
      satisfactory method is still to be found, and this lack is a great
      obstacle to the continuous operation of the suspension polymerization
      described above.
PAR  It is considered that the adhesion of a polymer to the inner wall of the
      polymerization vessel in the suspension polymerization process is caused
      by the monomer being first adsorbed on the inner wall and then being
      polymerized on the surface.
PAR  In view of this consideration, as one measure for preventing adhesion in
      the suspension polymerization of the ethylene halide in an aqueous medium,
      coating of various materials capable of adsorbing water and forming a film
      of water on the inner wall of the polymerization vessel has been
      heretofore practiced. However, in all cases, the film of water formed on
      the surface is composed of a monomolecular layer or at most 20 layers, and
      this film may be easily removed depending on change in the conditions
      surrounding the film, whereby it is thus impossible to maintain the film
      for a long period of time. Therefore, it is possible to attain temporary
      adhesion prevention using the prior art, but it is almost impossible to
      expect a continuous effect.
PAC  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
PAR  It is an object of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned
      problems of the prior art and to provide a process for the continuous
      suspension polymerization of the ethylene halides mentioned above and an
      apparatus therefor.
PAR  That is, in the suspension polymerization of at least one monomer selected
      from ethylene halides including vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene
      chloride, vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, or mixtures thereof or
      mixtures of an ethylene halide and a monomer copolymerizable therewith in
      an aqueous medium containing an oil-soluble catalyst and a suspending
      agent, polymerization under pressure is carried out in a pressure
      polymerization vessel in which the whole or at least adhesion susceptive
      surfaces of the inner wall and accessory instruments contained therein are
      lined with wood or are constructed of wood. As to the ability of wood to
      prevent adhesion in the process of the present invention, it is considered
      that because of its tendency to adsorb water, the wood forms a film of
      water on the surface thereof which acts as a barrier to a sticking
      polymer.
PAR  The wood used in the process of the present invention adsorbs water within
      the interior thereof and forms a film of water. As compared with the prior
      method in which a film of water is formed on the inner wall of the
      polymerization vessel merely using a thin coating of a wettable material,
      the process of the present invention provides a film of water which is
      thicker and not easily removed, and, accordingly, adhesion is effectively
      prevented. Moreover, this effect lasts for a long time.

PAL  Hydrogenated pullulan is produced by the reaction of an aqueous solution of
      pullulan with hydrogen gas under pressure in the presence of suitable
      catalysts until the reducing property of the solution disappears. The
      hydrogenated pullulan is much more resistant to heat than pullulan and its
      aqueous solution hardly loses viscosity and is not colored under heat
      treatment. The hydrogenated pullulan is much less absorbable by the
      intestinal walls than pullulan so as to reduce more effectively the
      caloric value of foods when it is mixed with foods. Shaped bodies such as
      films, sheets, plates, capsules, containers, coatings and fibers are
      readily prepared in a conventional manner. The films are practically
      impervious to atmospheric oxygen and suitable as packaging material.

PAL  Water-soluble metal complexes of sodium mannoheptonate in which the metal
      is an aluminum, iron or chromium trivalent ion. The water-soluble
      complexes are produced by reacting a water slurry of sodium mannoheptonate
      with a salt of the trivalent metal. The reaction products are useful for
      inhibiting the swelling and dispersion of clays and, in the case of the
      iron complex, as anti-chlorotic agents for the treatment of trees and
      plants.

PAL  Novel cephalosporin derivatives, for example N-acetoacetylcephalosporin C,
      N-decanoylcephalosporin C, N-dodecanoylcephalosporin C and
      N-hendecenoylcephalosporin C, are useful as readily-recoverable
      intermediates in the isolation of cephalosporin C value from fermentation
      broths and in the preparation of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid. They are
      prepared by treating an aqueous solution containing cephalosporin C, such
      as a fermentation broth, with diketene or an acid chloride such as
      decanoyl chloride, dodecanoyl chloride or hendecenoyl chloride, followed
      by solvent extraction. They are converted into 7-aminocephalosporanic acid
      by successively forming the silyl di-ester, halogenating to the
      imino-halide, converting the imino-ether and hydrolysing to 7-ACA.

      prepared by treating a 3-keto-6.beta.,7-diacyloxy-4-dehydro-steroid,
      preferably a 3-keto-6.beta.,7.beta.-diacyloxy-4-dehydrosteroid, wherein
      said acyloxy group is a good leaving group (e.g. hydrocarbonsulfonyloxy),
      with an azide salt in a nonreactive organic solvent. Novel intermediates

      3-keto-6.beta.,7.beta.-dihydroxy-4-dehydro-steroids and
      6.beta.,7.beta.-dihydrocarbonsulfonyloxy-esters thereof, are conveniently

      tetroxide followed by reductive cleavage of the 6.beta.,7.beta.-osmate
      ester thereby formed, isolating and thence esterifying the resulting

PAL  A novel series of 2-amino-5-spiro substituted oxazolin-4-ones and
      intermediates for making said compounds. These compounds are prepared by
      first converting the appropriately substituted cycloketone to the
      corresponding cyclocyanohydrin; converting this compounds to the
      corresponding hydroxy acid; esterifying the hydroxy acid, and finally
      cyclizing the hydroester to form the 2-amino-5-spiro substituted
      oxazolin-4-one. These compounds exhibit central nervous system activity
      and are active as either stimulants or depressants, and some are useful as
      performance enhancers.

PAL  A two-stage process for producing para-aminobenzoic acid by first reacting
      certain lower alkyl or glycol monoesters of terephthalic acid or specific
      salts thereof or mixtures thereof with ammonia in liquid phase at elevated
      temperatures and pressures to obtain a terephthalic acid monoamide
      intermediate, removing substantially all ammonia from this intermediate
      and then converting it into the para-aminobenzoic acid product by the
      Hofmann reaction, preferably using a sodium hypochlorite solution. The

PAL  Antibacterially effective 3-chloro-2-oxazolidinones are prepared by
      chlorination of an appropriate 2-oxazolidinone either with elemental
      chlorine in an aqueous medium or with a mono-, di- or trichloroisocyanuric
      acid (cyanuric chloride) in an inert organic solvent. The 2-oxazolidinones
      are, in turn, prepared by reaction of an appropriate ethanolamine either
      with a di-lower-alkyl carbonate in the presence of a strong base or with
      urea at an elevated temperature.

      bis (4-allyloxycarbonylphthalimide), or N,N'-allyloxycarbonylmethyl)
      pyromellitimide. When heated in the presence of a free radical initiator,
      these monomers give cured polymers having very superior mechanical
      strength, thermal stability, chemical resistance and electrical
      properties. If this polymerization is stopped before the reaction mixture
      is gelled, prepolymers can be obtained. The cured polymers are especially
      useful as electronics materials and engineering plastics.

PAL  This invention relates to a process of preparing phthalein indicator dyes
      including phthalides and naphthalides derived from certain
      hydroxy-substituted carbocyclic aryl compounds, such as phenols, and from
      certain N-heterocyclic aryl compounds, such as indoles, and to a process
      of preparing novel intermediates useful therein. According to the present
      invention, the selected carbocyclic compound or the selected
      N-heterocyclic compound is reacted with phthalaldehydic or
      naphthalaldehydic acid to form the corresponding (na)phthalidyl adduct
      which is treated with an oxidizing agent to yield the subject
      intermediates. To prepare the indicator dye, the intermediate, i.e., the
      oxidation product thus obtained is then reacted with a carbocyclic or
      heterocyclic aryl compound to yield the corresponding indicator dye. The
      oxidation products comprising the novel intermediates of the present
      invention may be dehydro or hydrated (na)phthalidyl adducts.

PAL  Alcohols and ethers are prepared by reacting a substituted hydrocarbon
      compound containing halogen or alkyl sulfate groups with an alkali metal
      hydroxide, in aqueous solution, in the presence of a catalytic amount of
      certain betaines and recovering from the reaction mixture the desired
      alcohol and/or ether. The reaction mixture can contain alcohols, ethers,
      and diethers, in varying amounts, depending on reactants and reaction
      conditions. Typical examples of materials used are: 1,4-dichlorobutane,
      sodium hydroxide, and tridodecylcarbomethoxymethyl ammonium bromide as the
      catalyst. The ethers are useful as solvents.

PAL  Anhydrides of carboxylic acids, more particularly, of aromatic, naphthenic
      and saturated aliphatic acids having at least one pair of carboxyl groups
      attached to adjacent carbon atoms, can be prepared by thermal
      decomposition of amine salts of the acids, with removal of the amine. The
      amine salts may be produced by aqueous hydrolysis of the corresponding
      nitriles, imides, or amides in the presence of an amine, or by hydrolysis
      to the ammonium salts followed by conversion to the amine salt by
      stripping off ammonia in the presence of an amine.

PAL   This invention relates to a process for recovering wax from filter cake
      derived from the treatment of sugar cane in the production of cane sugar.
      The process involves taking up the wax in water by forming an aqueous
      slurry of the filter cake, adding a surface active agent to the slurry to
      assist the release of wax from the fibres in the slurry and then heating
      the slurry to melt the wax which then passes into the water. Thereafter an
      extractant for the wax, such as kerosene, is added to the slurry to
      extract the wax whereafter the extractant is separated off, the wax is
      allowed to crystallize on cooling and is then recovered by filtration or
      centrifuging.

PAL  A process for the production of secondary alcohol ether sulfates which
      consists essentially of reacting adducts of secondary alkanols having from
      6 to 22 carbon atoms adducted with 1 to 10 mols of an alkylene oxide
      selected from the group consisting of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide,
      said adduct having at least 1 mol of oxypropylene per mol of alcohol, with
      at least a molecular equivalent of a sulfating agent stronger than
      concentrated sulfuric acid at temperatures of from 0.degree.C to
      50.degree.C and recovering said secondary alcohol ether sulfate.
PAC  THE PRIOR ART
PAR  At present secondary alcohols can be prepared from inexpensive raw
      materials, such as by oxidation of paraffins, substantially simpler than
      the preparation of primary alcohols. However, up to now the practical use
      of secondary alcohols is limited to non-ionic products prepared from them.
      Surface-active sulfates derived from secondary alcohols are used only in
      small amounts since the preparation of such raw materials for washing
      agents is very difficult, because of the instability of the secondary
      alkylsulfates. Primary alcohols, on the contrary, can be converted simply
      and with good yields into surface-active sulfates. In the sulfation of
      secondary alcohols, the conversion rates are low. In order to obtain
      somewhat usable products, expensive procedures have to be introduced, such
      as working with solvents and adduct formers, use of special sulfating
      agents, such as, for example, amidosulfonic acid, etc., as well as the
      addition of ethylene oxide adducts of primary alcohols. On the other hand,
      there is the possibility that by reaction of secondary alcohols with
      ethylene oxide, adducts with primary hydroxyl groups can be prepared, the
      sulfation products of which could be expected to have greater stability.
PAR  It is, however, very difficult to prepare ethoxylates of secondary alcohols
      with a high conversion rate and small amounts of by-products. A higher
      conversion rate of the secondary alcohols with ethylene oxide can only be
      attained by relatively cumbersome procedures, such as, for example, a
      two-step ethoxylation in which in the first step an acidic catalyst is
      used and, after distilling off the unreacted secondary alcohol, in the
      second step an alkaline catalyst is utilized. However, the ethoxylated
      secondary alcohols obtained by this expensive procedure are also
      unsatisfactorily sulfated and can only be sulfated by the application of
      special procedures. This is difficult to explain since by the ethoxylation
      of secondary alcohols, adducts with primary hydroxyl groups were formed.
PAC  OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION
PAR  An object of the present invention is the development of a simple process
      for the production of secondary alcohol ether sulfates utilizing
      conventional strong sulfating agents to give products with a high degree
      of sulfation.
PAR  Another object of the invention is the development of a process for the
      production of secondary alcohol ether sulfates which consists essentially
      of reacting adducts of secondary alkanols having from 6 to 22 carbon atoms
      adducted with 1 to 10 mols of an alkylene oxide selected from the group
      consisting of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, said adduct having at
      least 1 mol of oxypropylene per mol of alcohol, with at least a molecular
      equivalent of a sulfating agent stronger than concentrated sulfuric acid
      at temperatures of from 0.degree.C to 50.degree.C and recovering said
      secondary alcohol ether sulfate.
PAR  These and other objects of the invention will become more apparent as the
      description thereof proceeds.
PAC  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
PAR  It has now been surprisingly found that alkylene oxide adducts of secondary
      alcohols which contain at least one propylene glycol ether group can be
      sulfated simply with a high conversion rate. This result was the more
      unexpected since, as is known, on the introduction of propylene glycol
      ether groups by propoxylation, adducts with predominately secondary
      hydroxyl groups are formed. Therefore, the same difficulties in the
      further reaction of these adducts, especially in sulfation, would be
      expected as in the sulfation of secondary alcohols themselves. With this
      expectation, the sulfation of secondary alcohol propoxylates would appear
      to the expert as having little prospect of good yields.
PAR  The invention relates, therefore, to a process for the preparation of
      surface-active ether and polyether sulfates which is characterized in that
      adducts of secondary alkanols having 6 to 22 carbon atoms adducted with 1
      to 10 mols of alkylene oxide, possessing in the average at least 1 mol of
      propylene oxide per mol of alcohol, are reacted in a known manner at
      temperatures between 0.degree.C and 50.degree.C, particularly from
      10.degree.C and 30.degree.C, with strong sulfating agents in at least
      stoichiometric amounts.
PAR  As starting materials those adducts may be used that were obtained (1) by
      ethoxylation of secondary alcohols in the first step and subsequent
      propoxylation of the reaction mixtures, or (2) by reaction of secondary
      alcohols with ethylene oxide/propylene oxide mixtures, or (3) by the
      ethoxylation of reaction mixtures of secondary alcohols with propylene
      oxide, or (4) by pure propoxylation of secondary alcohols. The preferred
      starting materials are the adducts of propylene oxide to secondary
      alcohols or secondary alkanol propoxylates having 6 to 22 carbon atoms in
      the alkanol and 1 to 10 oxypropylene units.
PAR  The mixed alkoxylates to be used contain preferably 1 to 4, particularly 2
      to 3, oxyethylene groups. Of particular advantage among the pure propylene
      oxide adducts are those substance mixtures which were obtained by reaction
      of 1.5 to 5 mols of propylene oxide with 1 mol of secondary alcohol.
PAR  The starting materials can be obtained by conventional alkoxylation
      methods. The alkoxylation can be carried out both anionically, in the
      presence of alkaline alkoxylation catalysts, such as alkali metal
      hydroxides or alkali metal alcoholates, particularly sodium, potassium and
      lithium lower alkanolates, and cationically in the presence of acidic
      catalysts, such as BF.sub.3, or in the presence of the tertiary oxonium
      salts described as alkoxylation catalysts in Belgian Pat. No. 715,048.
PAR  If mixed adducts are used which have been obtained by propoxylation of
      ethylene oxide adducts of secondary alcohols as starting materials, such
      mixed adducts are preferred in which the alkoxylation in the first step
      was carried out by a cationic catalyst and in the second step with an
      anionic catalyst.
PAR  Among the mixed adducts which are obtained by simultaneous addition of
      ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, or by propoxylation in the first step
      and ethoxylation in the second step, as well as in the pure propoxylation
      products, these are preferably prepared by reaction with an anionic
      catalyst.
PAR  The secondary alcohols utilized to prepare the alkoxylation mixtures can be
      either compounds of uniform chain length or mixtures of homologs. Of
      particular economic advantage are those alcohol mixtures which have been
      obtained by the oxidation of paraffins in the presence of boron compounds,
      such as, for example, boric acid, boron trioxide, borates, boric acid
      esters, as well as other known reagents for the formation of secondary
      alcohols, such as arsenic acid, arsenic acid esters, arsenic trioxide, and
      others.
PAR  The alkoxylation mixtures utilizable for the subsequent sulfation can be
      used as crude products, that is, without intervening purification or
      processing operations. This is of essential importance for the technical
      execution of the process. These crude alkoxylation mixtures contain,
      therefore, in addition to the desired alkylene oxide adducts of secondary
      alcohols, as secondary constituents, the corresponding alkylene and/or
      polyalkylene glycols as well as, possibly, non-reacted secondary alcohol.
      The sulfation of the alkoxylate mixture is preferably carried out in the
      temperature range of from 10.degree.C to 30.degree.C.
PAR  By "strong sulfating agents" are meant those which are stronger than
      concentrated sulfuric acid, for example, SO.sub.3 or SO.sub.3 /air
      mixtures, oleum, chlorosulfonic acid, and the like. The addition of adduct
      formers for the sulfating agent or the presence of solvents are not
      required in the process. The preferred sulfating agent is chlorosulfonic
      acid. The mol ratio between the alkoxylate and the sulfating agent is
      advantageously chosen in the range of from 1:1.0 to 1:1.2, particularly in
      the range of from 1:1.02 to 1:1.1.
PAR  The sulfation reaction can be carried out continuously or discontinuously.
      The reaction times lie between fractions of seconds to about 20 minutes,
      depending upon the sulfating agent and/or sulfating apparatus used.
      Particularly short reaction times are attained if the reaction is carried
      out with very strong sulfating agents, such as SO.sub.3 /air mixtures, in
      modern short-time sulfation reactors which operate by the split-ring or
      falling film principle.
PAR  The products of the process have a substantially higher degree of sulfation
      than the products obtained by the sulfation of technical ethylene oxide
      adducts of secondary alcohols. They have, without further processing, very
      good surface-active properties and are superior, particularly in regard to
      their wetting action, to the known commercial sulfated adducts of ethylene
      oxide to primary alcohols.
PAR  The advantages attainable with the invention consist primarily in that as a
      raw material source for surface-active, water-soluble sulfates, secondary
      alcohols have been made available. Particularly those secondary alcohols
      which are easily obtainable by paraffin oxidation in the presence of the
      above-named oxidation catalysts to produce secondary alcohols with
      statistically distributed hydroxyl groups. These alcohols are converted by
      alkoxylation to the substances suitable for sulfation. Thus, these
      petrochemical raw materials can form the basis for the desired
      surface-active substances. Anionic active derivatives of secondary
      alcohols were up to now technically not producible by a simple way
      although secondary alcohols have been produced for some time on a large
      scale. The use of secondary alcohols was, therefore, until now limited to
      the production of non-ionic substances.
PAR  A further advantage of the process according to the invention can be seen
      in that the necessary alkoxylation may be carried out without a large
      expense in regard to catalysts and/or equipment.
PAR  The following examples are illustrative of the invention without being
      deemed limitative in any respect.

PAL  The invention disclosed is for a new and novel class of liquid polyene
      compositions formed of a molecule containing at least two unsaturated
      carbon-to-carbon bonds disposed at terminal positions on a main chain
      backbone of the molecule. The molecule includes unsaturated
      carbon-to-carbon bonds connected by a divalent chemically compatible
      derivative to a stable, organic, polyvalent, and polymeric member free of
      reactive carbon-to-carbon unsaturation and free of highly water-sensitive
      members. The new class of liquid polyene compositions which have a
      molecular weight in the range 300 to 20,000, and a viscosity in the range
      from essentially 0 to 20 million centipoises at 70.degree.C., may usefully
      form a component of a system which upon curing in the presence of a free
      radical generator and a polythiol, forms odorless, solid, elastomeric
      products. The cured products may be used as sealants, coatings, adhesives
      and molded articles.

PAL  Production of 2-phenyl-ethylene phosphonic acid by reacting styrene with
      phosphorus pentachloride in a molar ratio of about 1 : 2 in liquid phase
      and hydrolyzing the resulting complex 2-phenyl-ethylene phosphonic acid
      tetrachloride with water. The reaction is more particularly started with
      the use as the liquid phase of the equimolar mixture of 2-phenyl-ethylene
      phosphonic acid dichloride and phosphorus oxychloride obtained as an
      intermediary product; styrene and phosphorus pentachloride are introduced
      thereinto with continuous agitation; resulting complex 2-phenyl-ethylene
      phosphonic acid tetrachloride is partially hydrolyzed by adding a
      predetermined quantity of water to an equimolar mixture of
      2-phenyl-ethylene phosphonic acid dichloride and phosphorus oxychloride; a
      portion of the resulting clear solution is continuously used as the liquid
      phase and phosphorus oxychloride is continuously distilled off under
      reduced pressure from the balance portion of the solution; remaining
      2-phenyl-ethylene phosphonic acid dichloride is hydrolyzed by continuous
      addition of overstoichiometric proportions of water to an aqueous solution
      of 2-phenyl-ethylene phosphonic acid; the aqueous solution is cooled and
      crystalline phosphonic acid is precipitated therefrom.

PAL  Addition of non-transitional bismuth ion to oxidation catalysis provided by
      heavy, transition metal-bromine ion combination containing both cobalt and
      manganese ions uniquely increases catalytic activity of said combination
      for converting ortho substituted methyl groups to corresponding carboxylic
      acid groups on benzene nucleus by a factor much greater than by the
      addition of equivalent amount of such high catalytically active heavy,
      transition metal as cobalt and manganese. Such greater catalytic activity
      is manifested by longer sustained initial rapid rate of oxygen consumption
      and higher o-dicarboxybenzene yield.

      added to a mixture of sulfuric acid and methanol containing 50 - 150 parts
      by weight methanol per part sulfuric acid and holding the resulting
      composition at -10.degree. to 20.degree.C. The recovered O-methyl-isourea
      hydrogen sulfate is further converted to O-methyl-isourea sulfate with
      yields greatly exceeding 50%, and even 80%, by holding a mixture of
      approximately equimolar amounts of cyanamide and of the hydrogen sulfate
      in a liquid medium essentially consisting of methanol at 5.degree. to
      40.degree.C until the O-methyl-isourea sulfate is formed and can be

PAL  Certain new ar or ar' (alkylthio) benzoyl chloride phenylhydrazones have
      been found to be anthelmintics and active against arthropod pests. The
      benzoyl ring and the phenylhydrazone ring can be otherwise substituted
      with, for example, halogen atoms, nitro groups, .alpha.-fluoroalkyl
      groups, other alkylthio groups, and alkyl groups. The new compounds are
      prepared by reacting an ar or ar' (alkylthio) benzoic acid
      2-phenylhydrazide with phosphorus pentachloride to obtain an ar or ar'
      (alkylthio) benzoyl chloride (dichlorophosphinyl)phenylhydrazone that is
      reacted with phenol to produce the desired ar or ar' (alkylthio) benzoyl
      chloride phenylhydrazones. Certain of the compounds can be prepared by
      direct halogenation of (alkylthio)benzaldehyde phenylhydrazone or an
      (alkylthio)benzoyl chloride phenylhydrazone. Methods of anti-arthropodal
      use and novel formulations for use are also described.

      alternatively by reacting fluoranil with substantially pure anhydrous
      cobalt trifluoride. These compounds are clear, colorless liquids which are
      useful as monomers in the synthesis of thermally stable elastomeric
      polymers. Also disclosed is the dihydrate of said
      perfluorocyclohexane-1,4-dione, namely,
      octafluoro-1,1,4,4-cyclohexanetetraol. Another aspect of this invention is
      a series of polyethers formed by reacting said
      perfluorocyclohexane-1,4-dione with cesium fluoride and a cyclic or
      noncyclic aliphatic perhaloalkene having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and a
      fluorine atom on at least each of the carbon atoms connected by the double

PAL  Cyclo-olefins are converted in high yield to the corresponding
      chloro-nitroso dimers by dissolving the cyclo-olefin in liquid SO.sub.2
      and contacting with NOCl while maintaining a substantially oxygen-free
      environment. Even higher yields are attained by controlling the gradual
      addition of the NOCl and by using a molar ratio of NOCl to cyclo-olefin of
      less than about 0.92:1.

PAL  In a process for producing alkylaromatics by halogenating a paraffin and
      reacting the halogenated paraffin with an aromatic hydrocarbon, the rate
      of halogenation is improved by treating the n-paraffin to selectively
      remove oxygen-containing hydrocarbonaceous compounds from the n-paraffin
      with a sorbent selective for such oxygen-containing compounds, and
      subsequently halogenating the treated n-parffin. The improvement is
      particularly useful in producing alkylaromatic hydrocarbons from
      monocyclic aromatic compounds and n-paraffins.

      deactivating sulfur and nitrogen compounds and water by contacting the
      feed stream with liquid hydrofluoric acid. The treated feed stream is
      separated from the acid by gravity settling, charged to an alkylate
      fractionator, and passed through the isomerization process to form an
      isomerate which is returned to the alkylate fractionator and becomes a

PAL  Cascade Aeration mixing guns for oxygenating sewage are known in the art
      but cannot be properly scaled up, or paralleled in one unit. A double
      cascaded unit which incorporates integral baffles is shown so that
      capacity can be greatly increased, while maintaining efficiency.
PAR  This invention relates to aerators of the double funnel cascade type, as
      described in Canadian Pat. No. 937, 610 issued on Dec. 4, 1973 in the name
      of Jan W. Romanowski.
PAR  To reduce capital costs in any installation it is generally desirable to
      increase the size and reduce the numbers of aerators. Unfortunately the
      size of the aerator - the 12 inch diameter tube - of the above mentioned
      patent represents a good typical compromise of maximum aeration capacity
      and maximum aeration efficiency, on oxygen transfer. These quantities are
      to some extent interdependent, and tests show that both depend upon the
      depth of submersion. The abbreviated table below is an extract based on
      test results for such a 12 inch diameter unit.

PAL  Figures in the table are oxygen transfer rates in lbs. per hour.
PAR  Attempts to increase the throughput by scaling up the unit are very
      unsatisfactory. Superficially, to double the capacity would seem,
      erroneously, merely to require doubling all areas - a size increase from
      12 diameter to 18 inches ought to give ample margin. In practice this does
      not happen and the momentum of the increased air jet is such that proper
      mixing does not take place; doubling the depth helps somewhat, but the
      efficiency is still low; moreover, as increased excavation is expensive,
      doubling depth is a theoretical laboratory type suggestion rather than a
      practical expedient. Attempts at making twin parallel cascade funnels
      within a single tube gives disappointing results also.
PAR  Accordingly, this invention comprises an assembly adapted to aerate sewage
      comprising: oxygen-containing gas supply means having two delivery
      orifices to form two streams of gas; two first funnels converging
      downstream and secured downstream from and cooperating with said orifices
      so that oxygen-containing gas issuing from the orifice can entrain liquid
      and become mixed therewith; two second funnels converging downstream and
      spaced downstream from the first funnels; baffle means in the flow path
      between the exit from the first funnels and to the second funnels; means
      securing the first funnels, the baffle means and the second funnel
      together so that the mixture of oxygen-containing gas and sewage streaming
      from the exit of the first funnels impinges on the baffle means before
      entering the second funnels.
PAR  The invention will best be understood by reference to the drawings which
      illustrate by way of example a unit incorporating the invention.

      are disclosed. The polymeric compositions impart properties to the replica
      molds which allow the casting of high-quality plastic optical components
      such as ophthalmic lenses.
PAL  Among the polymeric compositions which have been found useful are: (1)
      cross-linked polymethyl methacrylate; (2) a copolymer of 99-20 parts
      methyl methacrylate and 1-80 parts acrylonitrile, preferably but not
      necessarily cross-linked; (3) cross-linked polystyrene; (4) a cross-linked
      copolymer of 90-10 parts styrene and 10-90 parts acrylonitrile; and, (5) a
      cross-linked copolymer of 90-10 parts styrene and 10-90 parts methyl
      methacrylate.
PAL  Replication processes including the steps of forming the polymeric replica
      molds described herein and subsequently using them in the casting of
      plastic lenses from materials such as polymerized allyl diglycol carbonate
      are also disclosed.

PAL  Small particles of metal, such as those used in making powder metal
      compacts, are produced by feeding the end of a metal wire or rod against
      the edge of a rotating disc and causing a direct electrical current to
      flow through the wire and disc. This melts the end of the wire and also
      creates a magnetic field about the wire. The rotation of the disc breaks
      the electrical contact and forms an arc which causes additional melting of
      the wire. Contact between the wire and disc takes place within a second
      electromagnetic field. Continuously advancing the end of the wire causes
      the intermittent making and breaking of electrical contact. The
      interaction of the two magnetic fields causes the molten particles to be
      removed from the area of contact. Means are provided for cooling and
      collecting the metal particles and for preventing the accumulation of
      solidified metal particles on the electromagnet or the rotating disc.
      Vacuum conditions may be used, thus producing a powder of high purity.

PAL  In molding polyurethane integral-skin foam the foam tends to stick to the
      mold surface. Conventional mold release agents have not been found
      effective; they fail to provide full release of the molded product, are
      not durable enough to withstand more than one molding cycle, interfere
      with development of the integral skin, or plate onto the integral-skin
      thus necessitating solvent washing of the molded foam product. This
      invention is a method of preparing a mold to release flexible polyurethane
      integral-skin foam, free from skin damage and other defects, that is
      durable, i.e., that will permit many molding cycles before requiring
      replacement, and that permits the molded foam to be merely water washed to
      remove all traces of the mold release agent.

PAL  Method for compacting preheated powder bodies in a high pressure isostatic
      pressure vessel in which a liquid such as water is used as the
      pressurizing medium. A preheated workpiece is inserted into the vessel
      which is closed and sealed. The vessel is then rapidly filled with the
      liquid pressurizing medium while avoiding contact of the medium with the
      preheated workpiece until the vessel is substantially completely full. The
      pressure within the vessel is then increased rapidly to a preselected
      compacting level by continually pumping the liquid pressurizing medium
      into the vessel. The preselected compacting pressure is in excess of the
      critical pressure of the liquid pressurizing medium. The rapid increase of
      pressure within the vessel to a level exceeding the critical pressure
      minimizes the amount of vapor that is formed in the vessel and reduces
      heat transfer from the preheated body to the pressurizing system.
PAL  In a preferred embodiment, avoidance of contact of the pressurizing medium
      with the preheated workpiece until the vessel is substantially completely
      filled is accomplished by the use of a shielding container. Alternative
      means are disclosed. Means for increasing the temperature of the workpiece
      after it is inserted into the pressure vessel are disclosed. Means for
      rapidly reducing the pressure within the vessel and for withdrawing the
      pressurizing medium are also disclosed.

PAL  A method for forming an extruded plastic sheet with vacuum pressure and
      without mating dies. The plastic sheet is extruded onto a heated portion
      of a supporting bed which maintains the sheet in a soft condition. The bed
      also includes a cooled portion adjacent to the heated portion with a
      plurality of parallel grooves which extend continuously through the cooled
      portion and at least partially through the heated portion. A vacuum
      pressure is provided within the grooves between the bed and sheet thereby
      pulling the sheet downwardly into the grooves. The residual heat within
      the sheet is then removed by the cooled portion of the bed to maintain the
      formed condition of the heated sheet. Various means are provided to
      maintain the vacuum pressure between the bed and sheet.

PAL  The invention is concerned with a method for making an article such as a
      container having a circular end wall and a side wall folded from the
      arcuate edge of the end wall, the article being first formed as a flat
      blank having two panels conforming to the base and side walls, the
      peripheries of the panels intersecting each other with a slit being formed
      in the common intersecting portions to form a pair of hinges at the ends
      of the slit enabling one panel to be folded upwardly with respect to the
      other between two mold tools without rupturing the hinges, plastic
      material being injected into the mold to join the folded panels into a
      unitary container or similar article.

PAL  A method of enhancing the tensile strength of carbon fibers of laboratory
      d commercial materials. Carbon fibers are immersed at ambient temperatures
      in liquid bromine or bromine dissolved in a solvent within a chemical
      resistant container for a period of time, the bromine is then removed by
      flushing with an inert gas. The removed bromine may be recovered and
      reused by condensing the vapor; small traces of bromine may remain within
      the fiber. It has been found that the bromine treatment enhances the
      tensile strength of the treated fiber.

PAL  A process for removal and conversion into sulfur of hydrogen sulfide in a
      gaseous or liquid material which comprises essentially treating the said
      material with a nitrohumic acid or its salt prepared by treating humic
      acid with a nitrating agent and, if necessary, converting the resultant
      into an alkaline salt. The process is advantageous essentially in that
      hydrogen sulfide can be removed economically and converted into sulfur,
      and that the desulfurization agent, i.e. a nitrohumic acid or its salt is
      non-toxic and non-corrosive.

PAL  A method of manifold copying using recording members having a dielectric
      surface on one side and surface of relatively lower resistivity on the
      opposite surface, which comprises forming a pack by placing sheet on sheet
      with the dielectric surfaces facing one way so that each dielectric
      surface excepting on one outer sheet is in contact with the lower
      resistivity surface of the next sheet, then placing the pack on a support
      with the lower resistivity surfaces on each sheet facing the support, then
      contacting the sheet further removed from the support with pressure
      imaging means, thereby to form a latent image on each dielectric surface,
      then separating the sheets of the pack and developing the latent image on
      each sheet by attracting thereto electroscopic marking particles.

PAL  The invention relates to a process for the insulative coating of electrical
      conductors with thermosetting resins. According to the invention, the
      resins used are thermosetting ester resins produced from polyhydric
      alcohols, carboxylic acids with two or more carboxyl groups attached to an
      aromatic ring and, as optional components, an aliphatic carboxylic acid
      and amino group-containing compounds. Low molecular weight resins are used
      containing from 0.85 to 1 mol of polyhydric alcohols per equivalent of
      co-condensed carboxylic acid. The resins used have a melt viscosity of at
      most 40,000 m Pa s at 120.degree.C. Coating is preferably carried out
      using a solvent-free composition, and at a low temperature.

PAL  An insulation system for marine tanker or land based liquid natural gas
      containers is formed in prefabricated modules bolted to an inner wall of
      the container. Adjacent modules are connected to provide a continuous
      insulation, liquid barrier and tension membrane. The confined liquid is in
      contact with a layer of closed cell polyurethane foam that incorporates
      means for relieving thermal stresses. The liquid tight primary foam layer
      is backed by a liquid tight fiberglass tension membrane and an additional
      layer of polyurethane foam. The fiberglass membrane is connected to
      cruciform fittings in the tank corners for reaction of contraction induced
      tensile forces. Handling and installation of the system is simplified by
      prefabricating the several layers of insulation and fiberglass membrane
      with a plywood panel supporting the system and providing an interface with
      the inner hull of the ship or inner tank surface. Damage and leak
      detection sensors are incorporated in the module at the membrane.

PAL  A top layer of transparent or translucent thermoplastic sheet material is
      printed on one side with a set of black color lines which form design
      lines that visually subdivide the one side into a plurality of portions.
      It is also printed on the other side with similar design lines registering
      with the ones on the first side, and in the portions it is printed with
      transparent inks of different colors. To one side of the sheet there is
      laminated a transparent second sheet, and the finished article has the
      appearance of a stained-glass object.

PAL  An assembly for imprinting indicia upon a tape in the form of a small strip
      of cloth, plastic, etc., to be applied by heat sensitive adhesive to an
      item to be identified by the indicia on the label. The assembly includes a
      sheet of carbon paper, or the like, for transfer of the marking material
      to the label by localized pressure, and a sheet of material having a
      pressure sensitive adhesive on one side. The assembly is so constructed
      that the tape is in facing engagement with the transfer layer of the
      carbon paper and the pressure sensitive adhesive is disposed for
      engagement with an underlying support surface to hold the assembly firmly
      in position while the markings are being applied.

PAL  The technique for forming on a substrate an abrasion-resistant layer having
      super-hydrophobic properties. Applied to the face of the substrate which
      has an inherently hydrophobic micro-pile formation are hydrophobic fumed
      silicon dioxide particles dispersed in a hydrophobic solvent. Dissolved in
      the solvent is a resinous binder in a small but effective amount which, by
      weight, is substantially less than one half the amount of the particles in
      the dispersion. Upon volatilization of the solvent, the resultant layer is
      composed primarily of fumed silicon dioxide particles strongly bonded to
      the face of the substrate.

PAL  This invention provides a process for the production of surface covering
      materials having a textured effect which comprises (a) applying a layer of
      a first foamable resinous composition on to a substrate; (b) applying a
      second foamable resinous composition on to selected areas of the surface
      of the said first foamable resinous composition; (c) applying at least one
      essentially non-foaming layer over the said first and second foamable
      resinous compositions; and (d) heating to effect foaming of the first and
      second foamable resinous compositions whereby a surface covering material
      having a textured effect is produced; the said first and second foamable
      resinous compositions being selected whereby upon heating substantial
      foaming of the said second foamable resinous compositions occurs before
      any substantial foaming of the said first foamable resinous composition.
      The invention further provides a surface covering material having a
      textured effect which comprises a substrate or backing layer, a layer of a
      first foamed resinous composition on the substrate or backing layer, a
      second foamed resinous composition on selected areas of the said first
      foamed resinous composition and a layer of an essentially non-foamed
      resinous composition over the said first and second foamed resinous
      compositions; the surface of the said material being at a higher level in
      areas with both first and second foamed resinous composition applied than
      in other areas of the surface covering material; and the said second
      foamed resinous composition having a structure characteristic of a
      resinous composition which has foamed to a significant extent whilst
      supported by a non-foaming substrate.

PAL  A simulated beverage pulp is prepared from a pregelatinized starch codried
      with a water-insoluble dye. A dry beverage mix is obtained by blending the
      pulp with other ingredients such as food solids which may be of the type
      desired in the beverage, thickeners such as other starches, gums and the
      like, sugars, acids, buffers, condiments and flavors. The beverage is
      prepared by reconstituting the mix with water.

PAL  There is disclosed an improved gaseous discharge display panel device and
      process of manufacturing same. A large number of cathode substrate
      electrode and mask structures are printed and fired on a single glass
      sheet, the electrodes being printed first and dried/cured at a higher
      temperature than subsequently applied mask and electrical crossovers,
      which are cured at lower temperatures. Upon completion of fabrication of
      the electrode and dielectric mask structures and crossover connections,
      the glass plate is simply scored and separated to provide individual back
      substrate and electrode mask structures which are then assembled with a
      like formed annode plate structure. Individual devices are then assembled
      with use of a seal rod preformed to have a gap in the seal structure and a
      laser facturable mercury dispensing giver. In forming the devices, the gas
      is processed through the small gap left in the seal structure and, the gap
      is closed with a short sealing rod through and about which outgasing and
      gas filling are formed during the final gasing step. Batch processing of
      devices in the range of 1,000-5,000 in a relatively short period of time.

PAL  A sheet material having a microporous surface of elastomeric polyurethane
      is treated to produce a sheet, which has greater water-proofness and still
      transmits water vapor, by applying to it a coagulated layer of elastomeric
      polyurethane. Preferably the coagulated layer is produced by applying a
      pigmented polyurethane solution to the sheet while it is wet with a
      non-solvent. The coagulated layer may then be treated in various ways;
      e.g. it may be embossed or treated with a solvent to form a fused glossy
      moisture vapor-transmitting surface. The product is suitable for use as a
      leather substitute in shoe uppers.

PAL  A strengthened glass-ceramic laminated article having a
      compressively-stressed surface layer substantially enveloping a
      tensilely-stressed core portion, produced by choosing the core and surface
      layer compositions such that the core undergoes a net positive
      differential densification with respect to the surface layer as the result
      of phase transformations occurring in the laminated article during
      crystallization in situ. Such an article offers significant advantages
      over glass and glass-ceramic articles strengthened by prior art methods,
      including improved mechanical stability, thermal shock resistance, and,
      most importantly, excellent high temperature strength retention.

PAL  A method of making a roofing shingle and an asphalt-saturated base sheet
      generally, utilizing a particular asphalt composition, are disclosed
      herein. The composition includes asphalt, which at least initially is in a
      molten state, and a filler material, preferably limestone or other similar
      mineral filler, dispersed throughout the molten asphalt. In addition, the
      composition includes a small amount of glass in the form of glass fiber
      bundles dispersed throughout the asphalt. The glass fiber bundles are made
      of monofilaments bonded together and are preselected to affect the
      viscosity of the molten asphalt in a predetermined way depending upon the
      temperature of the asphalt.

PAL  The invention provides a temporary light attenuation coating modification
      of the apertures in a multi-apertured pattern member for utilization in
      selected steps of the procedure for fabricating a patterned color screen
      structure disposed on the interior surface of a cathode ray tube viewing
      panel. The modification is in the form of a dried coating of a
      water-soluble polyhydric secondary alcohol uniformly covering the
      apertured portion of the pattern member to effect a bridging meniscus of
      coating in each of the apertures. Dissolved in the coating vehicle is a
      homogeneous dispersion of a ultraviolet absorbing material. Each
      attenuating meniscus effects a differential or graded degree of uv
      absorption resultant of the inherent variation in thickness of the
      bridging formation and the amount of uv absorber dissolved therein. In
      addition, the absorptive coating residual on the interstitial areas
      defining the apertures reduces deleterious reflections of actinic
      radiation during screen structure fabrication.

PAL  A process for hectographic duplicating, and hectographic copy paper
      therefor, are disclosed. The hectographic copy paper is formed by applying
      a coating of a film-forming vehicle and a colourless dyestuff precursor
      which is sodium p-carboxy phenyl leucauramine, sodium p-sulphophenyl
      leucauramine of Michler's hydrol methyl ether. The sheets are used to type
      or otherwise form an imaged hectographic master sheet, which is then
      contacted with hectographic copy sheets moistened with a spirit
      duplicating fluid, with the dyestuff precursors converted into dyestuffs
      on the hectographic copy sheets.

PAL  A highly piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride element is prepared by
      treating a polyvinylidene fluoride film having an infrared absorbance
      ratio D.sub.530 /D.sub.510 of not more than 1.2, namely having a major
      proportion of .beta.-type crystal structure, at a temperature of at least
      40.degree.C but below the melting point of the film while applying to the
      film a direct current voltage of 200 KV/cm to 1,500 KV/cm. The
      polyvinylidene fluoride film having a major proportion of .beta.-type
      crystal structure may be obtained by stretching a fabricated article of
      polyvinylidene fluoride having a major proportion of .alpha.-type crystal
      structure under specific conditions.

PAL  Fused silicide coatings for protecting niobium alloy substrates are
      modified by providing dispersed nucleation sites in the form of discrete
      particles in the coating. The discrete particles have a thermal expansion
      coefficient lower than that of the fused silicide material. This alters
      the microstructure and reduces the thermal expansion coefficient of the
      coating so as to minimize the number of tensile cracks.

PAL  A printed circuit board is prepared by connecting electronic components to
      the circuit, coating the board with a layer up to about 0.1 mil thick of a
      compound of the formula C.sub.n F.sub.2n.sub.+1 C.sub.m
      X.sub.2m.CHY--OOC--C(R)=CH.sub.2 or its prepolymer, replacing at least one
      of the electronic components, thermally bonding another electronic
      component to the circuit, and recoating the area around the new component
      with a layer of the compound or its prepolymer. In the formula n is 2 to
      9, m is 1 to 9, X and Y are H, F Cl, or Br and R is --H or --CH.sub.3.
      This method enables a printed circuit board to be easily repaired since
      the coating on the board can be soldered or welded through without first
      removing the coating or protecting the surrounding coating.

PAL  In an electrical cable having an impervious sheath thereabout defining a
      space between the cable and the sheath, a breather cap assembly is
      provided to enable the space between the cable and the sheath to be in
      free communication with the ambient atmosphere surrounding the sheath,
      while serving to prevent the ingress of water into the space. The breather
      cap assembly comprises a nipple which is threadedly secured to the sheath
      and includes an orifice extending longitudinally therethrough. A slot is
      provided in the end of the nipple and in communication with the orifice to
      prevent the orifice from being blocked inside the sheath. The other end of
      the nipple is threadedly secured to baffle means. The baffle means is a
      hollow member including an open end disposed furthest away from the nipple
      means and having a planar baffle staked within the interior of the baffle
      means and a cup-shaped baffle press fit therein and adjacent the opening.
      The planar baffle includes an opening coaxial with the orifice and the
      cup-shaped baffle includes plural openings disposed laterally of the axis
      of the orifice. The two baffles serve to increase the distance along the
      interior of the baffle means that water must traverse to reach the orifice
      and hence enter the sheath of the cable.

PAL  A high voltage distributor allowing the easy connection and disconnection
      of a high voltage power supply to and from one or more circuits requiring
      the supply. The design configuration features unrestrained "pump-out,"
      insulation of the high voltage from ground, and freedom from corona. These
      features are obtained by mounting a removable retaining rod on one or more
      insulators, thereby facilitating the support by the retaining rod of a
      plurality of washers. One of the washers is integrally connected to the
      high voltage power supply while the remaining washers are integrally
      connected to the circuits requiring the high voltage.

PAL  A video disc has a storage track formed of half wavelength pits alternating
      with lands. The track has a series of turns, individually of a generally
      circular path but undulating symmetrically about that path. The
      undulations of the several turns have such relative phase that the turns
      are in nested concentric relation and one component of the stored
      information represents the phase of the undulations.
PAL  The record is a replication of a master formed under the control of a laser
      writing beam modulated with the information to be stored. A Bragg cell in
      the optical path, responding to a cyclic frequency-modulated signal,
      optically displaces the writing beam about a reference path to develop
      undulations in the record storage track.

PAL  A document for transmission has ruled lines such as borders printed at
      predetermined locations thereon which do not constitute usable
      information. The main scan direction is perpendicular to the ruled lines.
      Each main scan line is pre-scanned to determine if the line contains
      information other than the ruled lines, and the main scan line is scanned
      again for transmission if information is encountered and skipped if
      information is not encountered. A gating signal is generated in
      synchronism with the pre-scanning step, but the gating signal is
      suppressed while the portions of the main scan line intersecting the ruled
      lines are being pre-scanned. If the gating signal and electrical signals
      resulting from pre-scanning usable information contained in the main scan
      line are sensed simultaneously, the line is scanned for transmission.

PAL  An automatic control to the optimum lens adjustment in an ACT gun in a
      television camera tube. A variation in the cathode and control electrode
      potential during the line flyback requires an adaptation of the lens
      voltage for optimum target erasing action. In the circuit a measurement of
      the anode current in the gun is effected because for an optimum target
      erasing action during the line flyback it is found that this current must
      be at a minimum. A measurement is effected about an adjusting point. In
      case of unequal current the optimum value is not yet reached and an
      adjusting point displacement is effected towards the optimum value
      whereafter a subsequent measurement is effected.

PAL  In a television receiver, an automatic phase control includes a phase
      detector which generates a control signal passed by a bandpass filter to a
      horizontal oscillator in order to synchronize locally generated horizontal
      pulses with the received horizontal sync pulses. A keyed AGC circuit in
      response to increased received signal strength decreases the gain of the
      RF and IF amplifying stages. When the received signal strength reaches a
      preselected level, as occurs during off-the-air signal reception, the AGC
      signal actuates a transistor switch which widens the passband of the
      filter in order to increase the ability to lock onto irregular sync
      signals.

PAL  A four-way electrostatic speaker system includes four step-up transformers
      which have their primary windings connected in a series-parallel circuit
      across an audio signal source. Electrostatic drivers connect to the
      secondary windings of each step-up transformer and each forms a parallel
      resonant circuit which is tuned to an audio frequency within the operating
      range of the electrostatic driver. The impedance reflected into the
      primary winding of each step-up transformer is such that the attached
      electrostatic driver predominantly receives frequencies within its
      operating range. The necessity of a separate crossover network is thus
      eliminated.

PAL  A time and zone metering system wherein a central store is used to
      accumulate the metering pulse total for each line. The central store
      consists of a magnetic disc with which a line scanner is synchronized.
      Each line is equipped with a pulse plus bias line gate that is also wired
      into a gating arrangement with the timing pulses, so that a combination of
      the allotted time by the scanner and the presence of a metering pulse is
      effective to cause a temporary record to be made. Included in the system
      is a timing means to verify the authenticity of the metering pulses. After
      storage of the metering marks in the temporary store other logic is
      effective to place the marks in the stores reserved for a particular line.

PAL  A communications system and method for transmitting and receiving two
      independently timed (asynchronous) binary data signals on a quadriphase
      carrier. The four phase ambiguity ordinarily resulting from quadriphase
      transmission and reception is overcome by uniquely identifying one input
      channel, for example, by slightly increasing the clock rate of the
      channel. In reception each channel is demodulated and the data rate of
      each channel is examined to identify the increased clock rate channel.
      That channel is then returned to its original clock rate.

PAL  A second level multiplexer for a PCM data system provides for fast
      reframing by utilizing the stuff words in the frame organization in
      addition to the main framing word. This provides a clear indication of a
      misframe condition. In addition, integration of errors by a counter
      supplies immunity to medium amounts of noise. The foregoing provides for
      an optimum environment for frame synchronized scrambling and descrambling
      to be accomplished.

PAL  A precise tone injection circuit for injecting tone signals to a constant
      current junctor circuit in a two-wire balanced circuit. The tone injection
      circuit includes a pair of transistors operating as constant current
      sources feeding the respective ones of the two wires. A phase splitter
      amplifier couples a tone signal to the base electrodes of the transistors
      to change the current through their collector electrodes via the emitter
      circuits thereof at a rate and frequency of the tone signals at the base.
      Since a two-wire balanced circuit is used, and the injected signal
      currents to each wire are 180.degree. out-of-phase, in-phase signals, that
      is, noise and voltage fluctuations, are reduced or rejected.

PAL  The specification discloses a system for automatically controlling the
      connection of inter-city telephone calls between a plurality of input
      telephone trunk lines at a user's branch exchange and a preset number of
      output telephone trunk lines. Circuitry is provided to receive user
      authorization code numbers from the user's facility and for comparing the
      user authorization code numbers with stored code numbers. A dial tone
      allowing further operation of the system is provided only if the user
      authorization code numbers match ones of the stored code numbers. The
      system receives dialing signals from an input telephone trunk line and in
      response thereto selects an available one of the output telephone trunk
      lines according to predetermined efficiency criteria. The system then
      establishes audio connections between the calling input telephone trunk
      line and the selected available output telephone trunk line to complete
      the inter-city call. If all output telephone trunk lines are busy, the
      caller may enter his request in a queue and the system will notify him
      when a circuit is available.

PAL  Time compression receiver for detecting the signalling tones in a DTMF
      (dual tone multi-frequency) format present on eight receiver input lines.
      A multiplexer repeatedly samples the input signals present on the eight
      input lines. These analog samples are converted to digital samples and
      stored in a memory. Stored samples are read out for each input line in
      order while new samples are being written into the memory. Samples are
      read out at twice the rate they are written in. The samples are converted
      to analog signals and passed through a low pass filter. The frequencies
      present in the resulting signal are speeded up by a factor of sixteen over
      the frequencies of the signalling tones present in the input signal from
      which it was derived. The signal frequencies are passed through reject
      filters, comparator and limiter circuits, a bank of tone filters, and
      level detectors to check for each possible resulting frequency and to
      produce an indication of the presence or absence of each.

PAL  In a four-channel stereophonic reproducing system of the type in which a
      first, second, third and fourth audio signals are reproduced from two
      stereophonic composite signals which are respectively comprised of a left
      side signal consisting of a main channel signal composed of the sum of the
      first and second audio signals and a sub-channel signal obtained by
      frequency modulating or phase modulating the difference between the first
      and second audio signals, and a right side signal consisting of a main
      channel signal composed of the sum of the third and fourth audio signals
      and a sub-channel signal obtained by frequency modulating or phase
      modulating the difference between the third and fourth audio signals, a
      detector circuit for detecting each sub-channel signal is followed by a
      filter circuit for eliminating undesired higher frequencies whereby to
      eliminate higher audio frequencies including increased noise components to

      the pushbutton and urges the push-button into a normally released position
      and pushes the switching member into contact with the first terminal and
      second terminals. An actuator is integral with the push-button and when
      the latter is depressed, it tilts the switching member around the first
      terminal to move the switching member away from the second terminal and
      into contact with the third terminal.

PAL  The present invention relates to switches and switch actuating devices to
      be operated for purposes of arming a bomb or other missile as it is
      dropped or released from an aircraft. The particular bomb or missile in
      which this invention is applied is one in which there is a plurality of
      circuits which are to be armed by the closing of switches upon dropping or
      releasing of the bomb. The operation of the switches to closed position is
      normally accomplished by means of a pull-out wire; that is, a wire which
      is withdrawn from the bomb or missile at the time of release of the bomb,
      one end of the wire being attached to the aircraft. The conditions to be
      met are that the arming switches must be positively and surely maintained
      in open position until the bomb is released and the arming action is
      effected. The action of the pull-out wire in achieving the arming action
      must be sure and positive with minimum danger of malfunctioning, jamming
      or binding.

PAL  Apparatus for welding adjacent longitudinal edges of a thin flat workpiece
      being formed into a tubular configuration is disclosed as comprising a
      single welding head and an associated welding head bracket including pivot
      means and vertical adjustment means for selectively positioning the
      welding head above the moving workpiece. The single welding head includes
      three welding electrodes having their welding tips disposed in spaced
      linear arrangement in the direction of the moving workpiece, and being
      adapted to individually receive electric power for the generation of
      separate welding arcs. Associated with each of two of the three welding
      electrodes is a tilt adjustment means for individually adjusting the
      alignment of such two electrodes during welding operation so that the
      welding baths created by such two said welding electrodes overlap the
      welding bath created by the centrally positioned third electrode. The
      single welding head is configured to be closely disposed to the output
      side of a forming station for the thin flat workpiece so that the seam of
      the tubular configuration formed may be welded prior to seam separation
      due to material resilience.

PAL  To permit coating of wide area work surfaces, such as wide tapes, ribbons
      and the like, a vaporization substance is retained in an elongated trough,
      transverse to the direction of movement of the ribbon. Alongside the
      trough, the pole shoes of magnets are placed to provide a magnetic shield
      transverse to the longitudinal extent of the trough, and with respect to
      the direction of movement of the web to be coated. An electron beam is
      then impinged on the surface of the vaporization substance in the trough
      at an angle between zero and 90.degree., preferably between 30.degree. and
      60.degree. and desirably in the order of about 45.degree. with respect to
      the direction of the magnetic field, so that the magnetic field and the
      electron beam will interact to deflect the electron beam to assume a
      spiral path which penetrates the surface of the vaporization substance.
      Preferably the characteristics of the electron beam and the magnetic field
      are so matched that primary electrons dispersed from the vapor, or from
      stray gases are captured in the magnetic field, and returned to the
      vaporization substance; likewise, electrons liberated at the impingement
      points are deflected back to the vaporization substance.

      fabricated thereover, a plurality of junctions formed on the semiconductor
      wafer, and electrodes to supply an inverse current to the junctions. The
      junctions are arranged so as to correspond to the pattern of the symbol,
      such as letters, to be printed. Each of the junctions is used as a heating
      element. Heat is evolved at the junction when the inverse current flows
      through the potential barrier which is formed at the junction. The heat
      evolved is used for the heating element.

PAL  Disclosed is a technique for producing vapors of metals in containment
      vessels that experience the melting temperature but not the boiling
      temperature of the metal being vaporized. The metal is maintained in
      molten pools by the containment vessel. Pumping means such as wicks
      transfer the metal from the pools to a higher temperature region internal
      of the containment vessel where the liquid metal is boiled into a vapor.
      The generation of laser radiation from an excited metal vapor produced in
      this manner is also disclosed.

PAL  A dielectric substrate is provided with a thin narrow heater strip of
      multi-layer metallic films of noble metals such as platinum and gold. The
      film heater is bonded to the substrate and it has terminal means
      comprising a silver film electrode that is spaced away from the film
      heater. A metal oxide diffusion barrier such as a tin oxide film bridges
      the gap between the film heater and the silver electrode and retards the
      electromigration and mass flow between the film heater and the electrode.

PAL  An automated fuel dispensing system provides semiattended operation
      utilizing a computerized credit authorization and billing technique by
      means of a direct connection to a regional credit center over
      communication lines. A control console for multiple pump dispensers
      interconnects with a local central controller for providing preliminary
      verification checks and generating an authorization request message for
      transmission to a central computer at the regional credit center. This
      initial verification is to identify a particular user with a credit
      document inserted into the control console. Following receipt of an
      authorization message from the central computer in response to an
      authorization request, a user selects one of the pump dispensers by
      actuating a push button at the control console; he then dispenses the
      amount of fuel desired. Following completion of the fuel dispensing
      routine, billing information is assembled in the local central controller
      as a message for transmission to the regional computer for credit billing
      to a particular account number. In addition to credit documents, the
      control console accepts currency and cash cards having a pre-established
      value for control of the dispensing of fuel up to the limit of the
      currency value or cash card value.

PAL  Logs which are to be divided into standard length blocks are first measured
      and their total length is displayed visually on an electronic readout
      device. Based on this length measurement, an operator selects one of
      several standard lengths and causes the log to advance relative to a
      cutoff saw where it is then cut. Total length measurement is determined by
      presetting a counter with a count representing maximum possible log
      length, down counting the counter when the trailing edge is detected and
      stopping the count when the leading edge reaches a reference position.
      Movement of the log is obtained from a tachometer generator mounted to
      rotate with a conveyor drive and an electronic circuit converts the output
      of the tachometer generator into pulses each representing a predetermined
      and convenient unit of length measurement.

      provides a throttle pressure setpoint, speed error and load demand for
      controlling the plant depending upon the operational states of the system,
      is disclosed. The analog portion of the system also controls the plant in
      cooperation with the digital computer for certain operational states and
      conditions when the digital computer is in operation; and the analog
      system alone controls the plant when the digital computer is out of
      service. The transfer between such control is effected depending upon the
      operational states of the system and certain of the components therein.
      The system also includes in the digital computer portion, the provision
      for preventing a load demand which is outside the limits of the reactor
      circulation system when the reactor is in a state of automatic operation.

PAL  At a measuring point serving at least one adjacent line segment
      instantaneous values of current and voltage are measured in sequential
      pairs, either continuously or at intervals by delaying these values by
      discrete amounts of delay corresponding to twice the wave propagation time
      on the line from the measuring point to a number of selected reference
      (appraisal) points along the line segment, and then combining the delayed
      value pairs corresponding to each appraisal point with a real time value
      pair. A voltage value at each appraisal point at the mid-point of the
      delay period is determined by use of delayed measured values that take
      account of line propagation characteristics such as damping. In one form
      of processing, the appraisal point voltage thus obtained is then squared
      or otherwise processed to provide a unimodal function, and then further
      processed by an average function generator to yield an evaluation function
      for the appraisal point which can effectively be compared with one or more
      limit values for control of warning and cut-off devices designed to be
      activated in case of a failure. In a second form of processing, the
      gradients of the appraisal point voltage at the two ends of the line
      segment in question are continually or sequentially calculated and their
      respective signs are compared in such a way as to activate warning and
      cut-out systems when the presence of a voltage minimum within the line
      segment is detected. The system operates without circuits of the kind that
      require measured voltages and currents to be resolved into sinusoidal
      components or proper evaluation of transients.

PAL  A combined digital computer/analog control system for operating a boiling
      water reactor-steam turbine-power plant wherein one of two analog throttle
      pressure controllers is used for controlling the inlet and bypass valves.
      One of the pressure controllers is biased to provide a higher signal than
      the other; and such nonbiased controller is the one selected to control
      the valves. Each controller includes a pressure transducer, a summing
      device and amplifier, and a lead/lag circuit together with the appropriate
      power supply.
PAL  A failure detection system is used to switch the controllers from automatic
      to manual when a predetermined combination of controller components
      becomes defective. Also, such system is so organized that a transducer
      failure for one controller causes the other controller to assume control
      regardless of whether such failure results in a higher or lower than
      proper signal.

PAL  A program controlled data processing system which includes two data
      manipulation units generally operated in parallel. The two data
      manipulation units, however, by design react differently in the execution
      of certain program order words. The system includes a circuit arrangement
      which compares data generated by the two data manipulation units and
      generates comparison signals indicating the identity or lack of identity
      of the compared data. The comparison signals are utilized in the detection
      of faults and errors and in the determination of conditions as defined by
      the program.

PAL  A greatly simplified calculator circuit implemented, for example, utilizing
      I.sup.2 L technology, is fabricated on a relatively small semiconductor
      chip resulting in high yield. A unique feature of such calculator which
      provides power-up clear to reset the calculator to a "zero" idle state
      when the calculator power is initially turned on is smaller and more
      reliable than the conventional open loop power-up clear circuits which
      rely entirely on an RC time constant thereby permitting fabrication on the
      smaller chip. The power-up clear circuit is a latch which forces the input
      of the program counter shift register to an initial logical state. The
      latch is reset by the logical NAND of the program counter outputs.

PAL  A circuit for sensing beginning of tape (BOT) and end of tape (EOT) tape
      position markers on digital magnetic tape includes an illumination source
      disposed to emit controlled illumination onto a marker sense position
      along the length of a tape path, a pair of photosensors disposed to sense
      illumination from the illumination source which is reflected from
      different positions across the width of a tape lying in the tape path, a
      control circuit coupled to control the illumination intensity emitted by
      the illumination source to maintain a predetermined illumination intensity
      at the photosensor receiving the least intense illumination, and a
      comparator connected to sense and indicate substantial differences in
      light intensities received by the two photosensors. The utilization of a
      feedback signal dependent on actually sensed illumination intensity
      permits the controlled illumination source to drive the photosensors with
      a predetermined reflected illumination intensity irrespective of the
      reflective characteristics of the magnetic tape over wide temperature
      variations. Adjustment of the gain for at least one photosensor amplifier
      readily permits compensation at the time of manufacture for deviations
      from symmetry in positioning the illumination source and photosensors as
      well as compensation for tolerance variations in circuit components.

PAL  In an optical switching system having a transmitter and a receiver
      optically coupled together via a fiber optic light guide, the transmitter
      utilizes a piezoelectric device which provides an electrical signal to a
      light emitting device when a mechanical strain is imparted to the
      piezoelectric device. The light emitted by the light source is provided at
      the receiver via the fiber optic guide. The receiver generates a signal in
      response to the light received thereat via the fiber optic guide. This
      generated signal is used to control the power flowing to a load via a
      switching device so that, for example, one generated signal is used to
      turn on the switching device and the next succeeding generated signal is
      used to turn off the switching device.

PAL  Optical detecting, tracking and indicating apparatus for producing a target
      angular position signal independent of target intensity. A photoconductive
      detector element has four outer electrodes disposed in a rhombic pattern
      and a centrally disposed inner electrode. A pair of quadrantly phased,
      alternating current primary bias signals are coupled to oppositely
      disposed electrode pairs. The central electrode is coupled through a load
      impedance and a source of secondary bias signal at a second frequency
      differing from the first bias signal frequency. A composite signal
      including both phase and frequency components of the primary bias signals
      appears in the output. The composite signal varies with target position
      and intensity. A secondary output signal at the second frequency varies
      only with intensity. A divider circuit divides the composite signal by the
      secondary signal to produce an output signal which varies only in
      accordance with the relative position of radiant energy impingent on the
      photoconductor.

PAL  Mass spectrometry apparatus for analyzing the composition of moving
      microscopic particles includes a capacitor having a front electrode upon
      which the particles impinge, a back electrode, and a solid dielectric
      sandwiched between the front and back electrodes. In one embodiment, the
      electrodes and dielectric are arcuately shaped as concentric peripheral
      segments of different spheres having a common center and different radii.
      The front electrode and dielectric together have a thickness such that an
      impinging particle can penetrate them. The front electrode is negatively
      biased relative to the back electrode so that an impinging particle causes
      the front and back electrodes to become electrically connected to form a
      discharge spark between the electrodes. The discharge spark causes
      ejection from the front electrode of positive ions of elements in the
      impinging particle. An electric field is formed in front of the front
      electrode by a grid that is pervious to the particles and ions. The grid
      is negatively biased relative to the front electrode to draw the ejected
      positive ions away from the front electrode, so they impinge on a positive
      ion detector target. The arrival time of different ions is measured to
      complete the analysis. In a second embodiment, the capacitor has planar,
      parallel electrodes, in which case the ejected positive ions are deflected
      downstream of a planar grid by a pair of spaced, arcuate capacitor plates
      having a region between them through which the ejected ions travel.

PAL  In an optical fiber power tap, signal power is coupled out of an optical
      fiber waveguide by a dielectric body disposed in a coupling relationship
      laterally offset from an intermediate length of the fiber, and is
      converted to a representative electrical signal suitable for utilization
      by a photodetector disposed adjacent to the dielectric body. In accordance
      with the disclosed invention, the operation of the fiber tap is improved
      by combining therewith means for coupling a portion of the signal power in
      the fiber from lower order modes to higher order modes. The mode coupling
      means illustratively comprises a pair of corrugated plates which is
      pressed against the fiber to periodically deform a region of the fiber
      just preceding the fiber tap. Provided the spatial periodicity of the
      corrugations in the plates is properly selected, and the pressure exerted
      on the plates is sufficiently large, the periodic deformation of the fiber
      causes the desired higher order mode coupling, and assures that there is
      sufficient power distributed in the higher order modes of the fiber for
      the dielectric coupling body of the fiber tap to couple out. The mode
      coupling means can be employed to provide an adjustable optical fiber tap,
      and can facilitate the tapping of clad fiber waveguides.

PAL  There is disclosed apparatus for scanning a concave coded record which is
      adapted to be disposed in the inside of an open-ended tube. A rotor
      carries a source of illumination which illuminates the record. Light
      reflected from the record is reflected onto a mirror carried by the rotor
      and passes along the axis of rotation of the rotor through a suitable lens
      or lenses and is focused on a mask. The mask has an aperture through which
      light passes to a light receptor such as a photodetector. The light
      receptor is stationarily mounted to the frame. The frame also mounts a
      motor for driving the rotor and bearings for rotatably mounting the rotor.
      A cover adapted to abut the end of the tube is mounted for movement
      between one position in which the cover is in the reflected light path and
      another position in which the cover is out of the reflected light path. A
      spring normally urges the cover into the one position but when the cover
      is moved into contact with the end of the tube the cover is moved to the
      other position at which the light receptor can receive light reflected
      from the coded record.

PAL  A detector of blemishes in a surface comprises a transmitting station from
      which a beam of light is caused to scan a moving surface to produce a
      raster pattern thereon. Light specularly reflected from, or transmitted
      by, the surface is collected at a receiving station after being diffused
      by a sheet of translucent material disposed in the path of this light. The
      diffused light in the receiving station is collected and directed by
      reflective surfaces towards a photodetector such that when the beam
      engages a blemish in the surface, the amount of light detected falls. The
      detector combines the sensitivity of collecting large amounts of
      specularly reflected light with a simple optical system associated with
      the collecting of diffused light.

PAL  A device for measuring transmission factors is comprised of an emitter of
      light impulses located at a distance from a main photoreceiver. The
      emitter and the main photoreceiver are optically conjugated by mirrors. An
      auxiliary photoreceiver located adjacent to the light emitter receives a
      constant portion of the flux emitted by this emitter and a flux coming
      from the ambient light. By establishing the ratio between the impulse-type
      electric signals transmitted by these photoreceivers, a value proportional
      to the transmission factor measured between the emitter and the main
      photoreceiver is obtained.

      state only when the voltage across such switching means is substantially
      zero, and to change from a conducting to a non-conducting state only when
      the current through each switching means is substantially zero.

PAL  A counter circuit counts all transitions of two or more overlapped out of
      phase bi-level signals under control of a start signal by combining the
      input signals via an exclusive OR circuit into a single signal having the
      transitions of all input signals. The levels of this single signal are
      applied to a polarity hold circuit and the level present upon the
      occurrence of an asynchronously occurring start signal is stored therein.
      The polarity hold circuit provides a pair of gating signals to a logical
      AND/OR network having an output containing both the positive and negative
      transitions of the single signal. The detected transitions are fed into a
      binary counter whose first stage consists of the AND/OR network.

PAL  The arc tube of an electric discharge lamp is surrounded by a reflective
      filter. The filter selectively reflects arc discharge radiation outside
      the visible range to which the arc tube wall is transparent and to which
      the arc plasma is optically thick, so that the reflected radiation is
      preferentially absorbed by the plasma and not by the arc tube wall.

PAL  The current flowing through the horizontal deflection coil of a cathod ray
      tube is controlled by a transistor which is switched between saturation
      and cut off by a circuit having a pulse generator for generating a pulse
      in response to a horizontal synchronizing pulse. The leading edge of the
      generated pulse is delayed before being applied to the controlling
      transistor which switches sometime thereafter due to the storage time of
      the transistor. To insure that the blanking of the electron beam of the
      tube takes place during the retrace time, the blanking interval is set to
      occur a period of time after the horizontal synchronizing signal which is
      less than the sum of the storage time of the transistor and the time which
      the leading edge of the generated pulse is delayed.

PAL  An over-voltage protection circuit for an electric generating machine
      having a controlled rectifier for shunting the output winding of the
      machine in the event of an over-voltage condition includes impedance means
      connected in series with the controlled rectifier and regulation circuitry
      responsive to current flowing through the impedance means for preventing
      the excitation of the field when the controlled rectifier is conductive.
      An improved triggering circuit including a Zener diode and a transistor
      switch is employed to assure proper triggering of the controlled
      rectifier.

PAL  The amplitude is detected of both the input and output signals of the
      circuit (such as an audio amplifier) it is desired to protect. When, for
      example, a short circuit occurs across the load being driven, there is a
      sudden change in the ratio of these amplitudes and in response to this
      change, the signal to the output driver stage of the circuit is shunted to
      ground.

PAL  An over voltage protection circuit for preventing excessive high voltages
      which exceed the X-ray isodose limits for human beings when the high
      voltage primary winding, the tuning coil, or the high voltage primary
      driving winding opens. The B+ voltage for the driving oscillator or
      horizontal driver is derived at a point in the circuit such that when
      circuit elements fail, the B+ voltage is removed thus turning off the
      drive to the high voltage circuit.

PAL  An electronic circuit including a transistor which is biased to conduction
      is provided to initiate actuation of an electromagnetic transducer. The
      transducer has first and second coils one of which actuates the sounder. A
      potential is induced in the other coil and this induced potential is used
      to cut off the transistor. The next cycle of operation is initiated when
      the induced potential falls below a predetermined value in response to the
      reduction of the magnetic flux which, in turn, was the result of the
      transistor having been cut off.

PAL  An n-phase electronically commutated motor has a stator with n angularly
      displaced phase windings, each of which comprises a pair of power
      windings, and each power winding is connected in series with a transistor
      power switch across an electric power source so that the power windings of
      each phase generate magnetic fluxes in opposite directions and operate in
      push-pull. A capacitive rotor sensor coupled to the motor rotor derives
      n-phase square wave rotor position signals displaced 360/n degrees apart
      at a frequency proportional to rotor speed and n sets of logic gates
      receive the rotor position signals and control the conduction interval of
      the power transistors. The logic gates are opened during rotor position
      signals which energize the power switches in a sequence that generates a
      rotating magnetic field within the stator.

      is fabricated from laminations of ferromagnetic material and includes a
      pair of electrically conductive induction rings disposed about the ends of
      the laminations in coaxial relationship with a longitudinal axis of the
      armature. A two coil stator is disposed in coaxial relationship with the
      armature and the coils are alternately energized by a multivibrator or a
      pair of oppositely poled half wave rectifiers connected to a source of
      alternating current voltage. In order to increase the duty cycle of the
      energizing current, each stator coil is provided with two coaxially wound
      parallel connected windings and a phase shifting capacitor connected in

      dependent direct voltage and a sawtooth voltage. A comparison circuit
      generates a motor drive signal having a duty cycle dependent on the
      relative voltage levels of the direct and sawtooth voltages. The

PAL  For driving a direct-current motor in tune with the frequency of an
      external synchronizing signal regardless of any abrupt change in the load
      or in the synchronizing signal frequency, a rotor position signal is
      produced in the form of a succession of pulses in phased relationship to
      the rotation of the motor. A first control circuit is provided to initiate
      the supply of electrical energy from a DC power supply to the motor in
      response to each pulse of the synchronizing signal and to suspend the
      supply of electrical energy in response to each pulse of the rotor
      position signal. This first control circuit is combined with second and
      third control circuits adapted to modify the operation of the first
      control circuit in event the motor has fallen out of synchronism. Thus,
      when the actual speed of the motor becomes higher than the required
      synchronous speed, the second control circuit operates to permit the motor
      to be fed continuously from the DC power supply, and when the actual motor
      speed becomes lower than the synchronous speed, the third control circuit
      operates to prevent the motor from being fed from the DC power supply,
      until the motor is pulled back into synchronous operation. Several other
      embodiments are disclosed.

PAL  A series of electrical signals of a frequency directly proportional to the
      speed of a motor controlled by a speed control circuit of the type which
      completes an energizing circuit for the motor through the current carrying
      electrodes of a switching transistor is generated. These signals are
      employed to produce a direct current reference potential signal which
      increases rapidly in magnitude when the motor becomes stalled. The
      reference potential signal is applied across the series combination of a
      Zener diode and the base-emitter electrodes of an NPN transistor for
      supplying base-emitter drive current to the transistor when the potential
      level thereof reaches a magnitude equal to the inverse breakdown potential
      of the Zener diode. The collector-emitter electrodes of the NPN transistor
      are connected in circuit with the motor speed control circuit in such a
      manner that the control circuit switching transistor is maintained not
      conductive while base-emitter drive current is supplied to the NPN
      transistor.

PAL  A circuit is disclosed for controlling and regulating the speed of a D.C.
      motor fed from a single-phase A.C. supply. A full-wave power bridge using
      two diodes and two silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR's) supplies
      unfiltered rectified A.C. to the motor. A first programmable unijunction
      transistor (PUT) is used to trigger the SCR's in response to a timing
      capacitor voltage applied to its anode. The timing capacitor is charged
      from a zener-regulated, full-wave bridge source through a speed-control
      resistor and thus provides triggering of the SCR's at a phase angle
      determined by said speed-control resistor. To obtain consistent triggering
      at the same phase angle, a second PUT is used to reset the voltage on the
      timing capacitor to zero at the end of each half cycle of the A.C. voltage
      to insure that the initial charge condition of said capacitor is always
      the same. A third SCR is triggered into conduction at the same that each
      bridge SCR is triggered and is connected to clamp the zener-regulated
      voltage to a low value during the conduction period. This prevents the
      possibility of the timing capacitor recharging to the trigger voltage a
      second time in the same half cycle and thus causing false triggering.

PAL  A milling or grinding machine for shaping a workpiece is disclosed wherein
      a shaping tool is displaced relative to a rotatable workpiece in
      accordance with coded displacement values of a series of signals stored on
      a perforated tape. The signals are extracted from the tape serially and
      are translated into command signals, which are applied to a stepping motor
      for imparting displacement to means supporting the shaping tool. The
      stored signals are extracted from the tape in response to output pulses
      derived from a frequency divider network, the input of which is connected
      to a pulse generator. The pulse generator is so coupled to means for
      rotating the workpiece as to provide a plurality of pulses for each
      predetermined angular displacement of the workpiece. The frequency divider
      network includes a plurality of successively connected frequency divider
      devices, each of which is manually settable to provide output pulses equal
      in number to the number of pulses applied to the input of the selected
      frequency divider device divided by the respective divider ratio to which
      the selected divider device is set. By adjusting the divider ratios set at
      the respective divider devices, the angular displacement of the workpiece
      is correlated with the displacement of the shaping tool in a predetermined
      manner.

      circuit portion which includes an isolating diode and an input filter
      including a choke and a polarized capacitor across the dc input. The
      dc-chopper portion of the inverter circuitry may either be centre-tapped
      -- where half of the primary winding is in the circuit at any time -- or
      bridge-type -- where all of the primary winding is in the circuit. In any
      event, the chopper portion uses SCR's, and has 180 electrical degree
      commutation; with a commutation capacitor across the primary winding of
      the output transformer and a commutation choke in series with the SCR's.
      Feedback is provided by feedback diodes which may be connected to taps on
      the primary winding of the transformer, or which may be in parallel with
      the commutation choke, and which in any event are connected in
      counter-polarity to the polarized input capacitor. The SCR's of the
      chopper circuitry may be isolated by diodes in series with them, from the
      primary winding of the output transformer.

PAL  In a DC power supply, a switching transistor and an inductor are connected
      in series between an unregulated DC supply and a DC output terminal. The
      output DC voltage is a function of the on to off ratio of the switching
      transistor. The switching period of the switching transistor is controlled
      by a load feedback circuit which compares the output voltage, as sensed by
      the voltage drop of the current through the switching transistor, with a
      sawtooth voltage from a synchronized oscillator. An overload detection
      circuit includes a diode and integrator coupled to a junction between the
      inductor and the switching transistor. When the switching transistor is
      turned off, the load current which was flowing through the switching
      transistor is diverted to the diode. The current through the diode is thus
      directly proportional to the load current. The load current is detected
      and causes disabling of the load feedback circuit when the load current
      rises above a predetermined level.

PAL  An EPR spectrometer of high sensitivity and low cost particularly adapted
      for studying liquid samples of high dielectric loss such as water. A
      microwave cavity is employed oscillating either in the rectangular
      TE.sub.lOn or cylindrical TM.sub.lmO mode, where l, m, and n are integers.
      The cavity dimension corresponding to zero index is small, of the order of
      2 mm for a spectrometer operating at 10 GHz, resulting in (1) the cavity
      frequency is unchanged (2) the cavity Q is unusually low (3) the cavity
      filling factor for 1 mm inner diameter cylindrical sample tubes is
      unusually high. The product of the Q and the filling factor, which product
      determines the EPR sensitivity, is as high a value as is found in larger
      high Q cavities. The requisite magnet gap is unusually small, thus greatly
      lowering the weight and cost of the magnet required. Rather noisy
      inexpensive low quality microwave sources can be used without degradation
      in sensitivity because of the low Q. Low Q lessens demodulation of
      microwave oscillator FM noise or enhancement of AM noise. An alternative
      aqueous cell of flat cuvette shape can be used oriented perpendicular to
      the cavity dimension corresponding to the zero index yielding improved
      sensitivity.

      oscillatory circuit includes also a two stage amplifier with zero phase
      shift and a capacitor between the output of the amplifier and earth. The
      oscillatory circuit operates to successively decrease its output amplitude
      when the detector is moved from free air to adjacent a flawless surface
      and then adjacent a flaw in the surface.

PAL  This invention relates to methods of measuring magnetic fields and a
      magnetometer for performing the method.
PAL  According to the method an alternating magnetic field is applied to a thin
      magnetic film along its axis of difficult magnetization.
PAL  The alternating magnetic field applied to the film has an amplitude which
      is less than the anisotropy field of the film, the direction of
      magnetization of the film then undergoing an oscillation without reversal.
PAL  An electrical signal representing variations per unit of time of the
      magnetic induction in the film is withdrawn and analyzed and to effect the
      analysis the component of the magnetic field is measured at any of the odd
      harmonic frequencies of the electrical signal. The electrical signal is
      obtained by collecting the voltage at the terminals of a conducted loop
      surrounding the film and having its axis directed along the easy axis of
      the film.

      comparison is not made, an error in the manufacturing process is
      indicated. Failure of any of the expected light emitting diodes to light
      indicates missing or electrically bad connections; extra lighted light
      emitting diodes indicate extraneous connections or short circuits on the

PAL  A transceiver, adapted for use as either a master or a slave in a duplex
      pair, has a single, voltage-tunable, solid-state oscillator to provide the
      carrier frequency wave, a small portion of which is mixed with the
      received wave and applied therewith to a single ended mixer; an automatic
      gain-controlled loop cancels transmitter input modulation from the
      receiver output. The desired oscillator carrier frequency of the master
      transceiver is locked to a frequency within the pass band of an RF filter
      at the receiver input and separated from the center frequency of the
      filter by one-half the receiver IF frequency. The slave transceiver is
      first locked to a frequency within the pass band of the filter on the
      opposite side of its center frequency and separated therefrom by one-half
      the IF frequency (the slave thus offset from the master by their common IF
      frequency). Thereafter, upon sensing output from its IF amplifier (from
      the master), the slave is switched to operate in response to AFC developed
      by the received signal, such that the master and slave transceivers are
      locked together at frequencies differing by their common IF frequency. The
      RF filter also limits the signals to which the receiver can respond. An
      integrating amplifier provides demodulator and AFC filtering and, together
      with a bistable device, initial sweeping of the oscillator control voltage
      in respective directions depending on being in the master mode or the
      slave mode. Internal auxiliary modulation provides for pre-transmission
      transmitter modulation cancellation and frequency stability.

PAL  An intermediate frequency amplifier stage includes a tuned circuit which is
      shunted by a transistor utilized as an emitter follower, the emitter
      follower being responsive to the amplitude of a detected signal to lower
      the "Q" of the tuned circuit as the amplitude of the detected signal
      increases and to increase the "Q" of the tuned circuit as the amplitude of
      the detected signal decreases, thus effecting the gain of the intermediate
      frequency amplifier stage inversely respective the amplitude of the
      detected signal.

PAL  A single, non-bandswitched local oscillator in a UHF, VHF, CATV television
      receiver tuner system is employed with frequency multiplying and, or
      frequency dividing to obtain the required IF frequencies. The tuner
      operates in a double frequency conversion mode at UHF frequency with a
      tuned VHF RF amplifier dual functioning as a UHF IF amplifier. A UHF
      preselector and the VHF RF amplifier are gang-tuned with the local
      oscillator. The tuner operates in a single frequency conversion mode at
      VHF and CATV frequencies, and one of the local oscillator frequency
      dividing or doubling stages is utilized to distinguish the VHF low band
      from the high VHF-CATV tuning band.

      and selected channel numbers and (2) the intrachannel fraction is within
      predetermined limits such that the system is tuned to receive only signals
      falling within a restricted frequency range. If no signal is recognized,
      the counter supplies a next adjacent channel number to the comparator.
      Signal recognition means stop further operation of the counter upon
      recognition of a signal within the restricted frequency range.

PAL  A switching power amplifier for use in low-frequency sonar applications.
       s amplifier comprises a set of four switching transistors arranged in a
      bridge configuration for switching a power source through a highly
      resonant, low-frequency, underwater transducer. The signal to be amplified
      is taken from a signal generator, filtered, converted to voltage logic
      levels, delayed and modified a predetermined amount in time to prevent a
      power short circuit through the bridge due to slow transistor switching,
      and applied to a set of four voltage transformers. A different voltage
      transformer is coupled to each of the switching transistors in the bridge
      circuit. These voltage transformers are coupled to switch their respective
      bridge transistors only when their primary currents are collapsing, thus
      effectively decoupling the bridge transistors and the power source from
      the signal conditioner and driver delay circuitry.
PAL  An inductance is connected in electrical series with the underwater
      transducer to form a series resonant circuit with the transducer's shunt
      capacitance. This resonant circuit converts the squarewave output from the
      bridge to its sinewave fundamental so that it may be applied to drive the
      transducer. This resonant circuit also protects the transducer from short
      circuit currents and voltages.

      analog signal to the substantially constant power level. This permits
      amplification of the input signal to a level approaching the maximum level
      expressible by the digital words and significantly reduces the
      quantization noise of the converter by maximizing the number of digital
      words which are available to express the signal amplitude.

PAL  A high-accuracy phase comparison system for noise-contaminated
      fixed-frequency input signals, such as Omega radionavigation signals,
      employs a pair of phaselock loops in which output pulses from a
      high-frequency oscillator are deleted at the frequency of a
      variable-frequency oscillator which is responsive to the detected phase
      difference between the associated input signal and an associated reference
      signal, thereby to provide a high-frequency intermediate signal which is
      frequency-divided to produce the reference signal continuously and free of
      noise. The relative phase of the input signals may be determined by
      phase-comparing the reference signals of the two phaselock loops or, to
      provide even higher precision, by phase-comparing the variable-frequency
      signals of the two loops.

PAL  Disclosed is a microwave power accumulator including a plurality of coaxial
      oscillator circuits, each tightly coupled to a single common output
      combining resonant cavity. Each of the coaxial circuits includes a
      negative resistance diode at one end and a lossy terminating (microwave
      absorbing) material at the other end which absorbs and suppresses resonant
      modes within each coaxial circuit. This feature enables the cavity
      resonance of the common output combining cavity to dominate all of the
      individual coaxial circuits spaced therearound. The spacing of these
      coaxial circuit modules around a common cylindrical output combining
      cavity permits a high packing density and good individual heat sinking for
      the accumulator.

PAL  An odd number of cascaded inverter stages are connected in a ring
      configuration. Each stage has a control terminal associated therewith. The
      signal propagation delay time through a particular stage is controlled by
      the application of control signals to the control terminal. The frequency
      of the output signal is determined by the delay per stage and the number
      of stages in the ring configuration. The output signal can be taken from a
      point between any two cascaded stages in the ring.

      light is guided along a thin plate of the crystal. Acoustic waves are
      generated which move across the thickness of the crystal, modulating the

PAL  Ideally, when a signal is quantized, the range of the quantizer should be
      matched to the power of the signal. Disclosed herein is adaptive quantizer
      apparatus which utilizes a particular quantizing scheme for those
      communications where the power of the signal to be quantized is unknown,
      but remains constant for the duration of a communication. The amplitude
      range of an adaptive quantizer is adjusted during an initial training
      period to a value appropriate to the power of the applied input signal.
      This is accomplished by successively altering the amplitude range by a
      multiplicative quantity that depends upon the amplitude of the quantizer
      output signal and upon the time elapsed since the onset of the training
      period.

PAL  Apparatus and method for phase-encoding electro-acoustic electro-acoustic
      elements, elements of an acoustic surface wave device to provide
      preselected transducer characteristics. By altering the position of a
      transducer element or portions of a transducer element, the phase of the
      acoustic wave propagated from, or the phase of the electrical signal
      received by the transducer element can be varied by an amount determined
      by the velocity of propagation of the acoustic wave.
PAL  By altering the location of the electro-elements, or portions thereof, from
      a position determined for example by amplitude-encoding techniques, a
      resultant signal produced by a plurality of electro-acoustic elements,
      element portions, or combination of elements and element portions can
      provide the preselected transducer characteristics. In addition, the
      elements or element portions can be located such that the overlap
      amplitude between adjacent electro-acoustic elements is substantially a
      constant, providing increased directionality for acoustic waves orignating
      at the transducer.
PAL  According to one embodiment, each electro-acoustic transducer can be
      phase-encoded permitting both an input and an output transducer to be
      phase-encoded with preselected characteristics.
PAL  According to a second embodiment, the elements or portions thereof of a
      first transducer are displaced relative to elements or portions thereof of
      a second transducer to provide appropriate device phase-encoding.

PAL  A microwave hybrid junction with two of the four terminal pairs terminated
      with matched switchable impedances driven by interconnected circuitry such
      that if one of the impedances is in its high impedance state, the other is
      always in its low impedance state and vice versa, providing high energy
      transfer over a wide band with selectable phase inversion of the output.
      In combination with other hybrid junctions, a wide and flexible variety of
      input and output conditions can be obtained by switching the switchable
      impedances.

PAL  In a mechanical filter, a pair of transducer elements of truncated circular
      cross-section are disposed at the input and output sides respectively, and
      they are mechanically connected in cascade to each other by means of a
      coupler member. The areas of the truncated cross-section of the transducer
      elements are made different from each other. Between said pair of
      transducer elements may be provided one or more resonator elements each
      provided with a recess and connected to each other and to said transducer
      elements by said coupler member. Each of the transducers and resonators
      are mounted on a mount base plate by means of a bent wire-like support
      member having a pair of legs. The foregoing mechanical filter is
      accommodated in a container which is pressure-reduced and hermetically
      sealed.

PAL  Each of the inputs of an analog multiplexer are connected to a plurality of
      capacitive keyswitches and a reference capacitor. At the first multiplexer
      scan position, the reference capacitor is charged through a charging
      resistor and when a predetermined voltage is reached a threshold amplifier
      is caused to respond. The time period required to charge the reference
      capacitor is stored and compared with the time period required to charge
      each of the keyswitches. A control signal is generated in response to this
      comparison providing a signal representative of the capacitive value of
      the keyswitch in relation to the reference capacitor and thus the
      operative condition of the keyswitch.

PAL  Disclosed is a method and apparatus for program event recording in a data
      processing system and is used, for example, in debugging programs. A
      program event occurs whenever an address in the data processing system
      falls within a range between a control lower address (DTCL) and a control
      upper address (DTCU). The system detects a program event without degrading
      system performance using carry-lookahead adder structures which implement
      four inequality relationships.

PAL  Disclosed is a system for sorting information such as used, for example, in
      inventory control. New items to be sorted are fetched from a memory unit
      and are stored as buffered items in buffer stores. Comparators compare
      each new item from the memory unit with each of the buffered items in the
      buffer stores and with a lower limit and an upper limit. Item sort address
      registers store addresses which define the sorted order of the items in
      the buffer stores. After comparison of each new item, the item sort
      address registers are updated by the results of the comparison to
      establish a new sorted order and to cause rejected buffered items to be
      deleted from the buffer stores to make room for accepted new items.
      Reformatting apparatus is provided for reformatting items from the memory
      unit which have variable length and different weight fields such as
      prefix, body and suffix fields. Apparatus is provided for recognizing
      control fields which cause items to be ignored or included within the
      sorting process.

PAL  A data processing system in which the operating logic thereof is arranged
      to provide for an overlapping of the access, or "fetch" operations such
      that access to a second memory module can be obtained by a processor unit
      before a data transfer has been completed with respect to a first memory
      module and read-out of the second memory module can process during the
      rewrite cycle of the first module to reduce the overall processing time.
      Such operation is made even more effective by arranging the system to
      utilize memory interleaving techniques. Further, the system of the
      invention can provide for multiprocessor operation with a single memory
      system by the use of appropriate time-sharing techniques wherein
      processors can be operated in time-phased pairs, suitable multiprocessor
      control logic being arranged to provide for preselected priority
      allocations among the multiple processors to permit the most effective
      management of the multiprocessor system.

PAL  Disclosed is a controller which functions to interconnect and control one
      or more digital devices such as magnetic discs, typewriters and other
      digital data processing equipment. The controller receives input signals
      and delivers output signals through interface vector (IV) buffer stores
      which connect to and from user devices. The logical state of the output
      signals in the buffer stores is determined by an instruction-controlled
      processor which accesses instructions from a memory. The instructions are
      processed in response to input signals (operands) from buffer stores and
      produce output signals (operands) to the buffer stores. The instruction
      fetching paths and the operand fetching and storing paths are separate.
      The controller includes apparatus and an instruction set which allows
      variable fields in the buffer stores to be addressed to provide source
      operands and to be addressed to store result operands after instruction
      execution.

PAL  A drive circuit for a solid-state store comprises two transistors, only one
      of which is conductive under the control of a primary drive signal. By
      means of a capacitor, a second drive signal can be allowed if such signal
      is sufficiently synchronized with the primary drive signal. This second
      drive signal is, for example, the write command signal which appears
      approximately simultaneously with the primary drive signal during a write
      operation. In the latter case, the signal appearing first is effective.
      Tolerances at the instant of appearance of the two drive signals are thus
      rendered ineffective.

      semiconductor body of one conductivity type having a planar surface, and a
      first transistor formed in the body having emitter, base and collector
      regions. The emitter is coupled to the word line and the base is coupled
      to the bit signal input. The collector region is of opposite conductivity
      type and is formed in the body extending to the surface to form a junction
      boundary between the collector and the body capable of exhibiting
      capacitance thereacross. A second transistor is formed in the body having
      emitter, base and collector regions. The base region is coupled to the bit
      signal input. The emitter and collector regions are connected between the
      word line and the collector of the first transistor and are capable of
      providing a forward current path from said first transistor collector to

PAL  A completely enclosed housing of a magnetically permeable material contains
      a pair of magnetic discs. A magnetic bubble chip mounted in a gap between
      the magnetic discs is thereby subjected to a d.c. magnetic bias field
      provided by the discs but is also shielded from the effects of external
      magnetic fields. The device may be precisely magnetized by applying in
      succession two external magnetic fields of suitable magnitude, in opposite

PAL  Temperature is sensed in equipment where life is reduced by
      overtemperature. The sensed temperature is compared to a set point and an
      output indication showing overtemperature operation is provided to the
      equipment operator. In addition, a signal is produced which is
      proportional to the sensed temperature above a reference or threshold
      value. This signal is passed through a coulomb meter which indicates the
      total charge. This charge is an integration of the product of the time of
      duration and the amount of overtemperature, for indicating the accumulated
      thermal stesses.

PAL  Solid-state circuitry is provided for an electrical thermometer for
      monitoring the interior temperature of food being cooked. A temperature
      sensing thermistor located in the tip of a probe, adapted to be partially
      inserted in food being cooked so as to monitor the interior temperature,
      is combined in circuit with a programmable unijunction transistor (PUT),
      used as a bridge threshold detector, an NPN transistor-diode load current
      switch and a buzzer alarm coil such that upon the reaching of a preset
      temperature within the food, the buzzer alarm is actuated. The self-heat
      of the thermistor probe provides a latching effect ensuring the continued
      firing of the PUT with the resultant smooth operation of the buzzer alarm.
      A resistor is combined in circuit to allow a slight back current to flow
      through the buzzer coil, thereby allowing the use of a buzzer alarm with a
      fairly non-critical air gap.

PAL  A reliable earth terminal for satellite communications systems capable of
      unattended operation for extended periods of time is disclosed. The
      terminal includes an antenna with a single fixed reflector which can
      provide multiple beams, each of which can be positioned by small feed
      motion. The transmitter is of a modular construction, using a relatively
      low power traveling wave tube power amplifier for each increment in the
      operating band. The transmitting chains are designed to carry voice, data,
      or television signals to a satellite and include a modulator, IF
      amplifier, band-limiting filter, frequency converter, and power amplifier.
      Each amplifier is capable of operating over the full operating band;
      however, operation of each amplifier is limited to an assigned increment
      through the use of band-limiting filters. A single, redundant high power
      amplifier is provided and may be remotely switched into any one of the
      transmitting chains in the event of a failure. Amplifier outputs are
      connected to the antenna through a directional filter multiplexer. The
      receiver includes a low noise preamplifier featuring modular, "fail-soft"
      design. The receiving chains following the low noise preamplifier are
      channelized into band increments corresponding to those of the
      transmitting chains with separate converter and demodulator modules for
      each carrier. All subsystems are broadband, and channel bandwidth is
      determined only by intermediate frequency band pass filters. Prime power
      is low voltage battery banks constantly recharged by a commercial power
      source. The terminal can be operated for a limited period of time solely
      on the battery bands during commercial outages. A back-up motor generator
      provides recharging power during extended periods of commercial outages.
      The terminal is monitored and controlled from a central control point.
      Since the terminal is both automatic and self-protecting, remote control
      is limited to parameter adjustments required for normal operation, such as
      antenna feed positioning, changes in transmitter power, and switching to
      the spare power amplifier or turning off any carrier.

PAL  To shift the movable lenses of a verifocal objective, or to adjust the
      leaves of an iris diaphragm, a flat or cylindrically curved control
      element is formed with camming grooves coacting with projections on the
      controlled members. The control element is a deformable foil, e.g. of
      sheet metal, in which the camming grooves are formed by deep-drawing. The
      foil rests against a backing element with which it is positively connected
      by a tongue-and-groove coupling or the like and which entrains the control
      element upon being rotated about their common axis by an external force.

      obtained from a P-type semiconductor into which free electrons are
      injected from the source or drain of an FET whose channel is normally
      blocked. Incident photons absorbed in the channel region unblock the FET
      causing electron emission. Preferably, the device comprises an imaging

PAL  Time base instability of signals in a train thereof is corrected by use of
      analog shift registers. As employed in the correction of time base
      instability of video signals, paired analog shift registers are used.
      While one register has samples of one video line signal clocked into it at
      a rate corresponding to its time base instability, the other register
      clocks out, at a uniform rate, analog signals of the previous line, and
      vice versa.

PAL  A track or stripe tape positioner for a helical scan or rotary head
      recorder uses digital techniques. The expected step size is preset into a
      counter. During the next phase, a calibration phase, the tape is stepped
      through a plurality of stripes whereat the preset value is adjusted to
      measured values. In the third phase, the average step size is maintained
      subject to certain averaged changes thus providing a high degree of noise
      rejection to ensure reliable incremental stepping of a record tape through
      the recorder.

PAL  A magnetic head arm assembly has a suspension for an air bearing head
      slider that includes a substantially rectangular flexure with two parallel
      flexible narrow fingers and relatively stiff crosslegs, and a central
      finger to which the slider is attached. A load beam is fastened to the
      flexure so as to engage a load protuberance formed with the central
      finger. Flexibility of pitch around a longitudinal axis and roll around an
      orthogonol axis are provided thereby. Stiffness and rigidity against
      radial, circumferential and yaw motions are also realized.

PAL  This invention provides a magnetic head constituted by a magnetic core
      having a winding wound thereon, the magnetic core being a ferrite body
      composed of crystallites which have (111)-crystallographic planes thereof
      oriented substantially parallel with each other. The ferrite body is a
      dense polycrystalline and has much improved wear characteristics. The
      method of manufacturing the polycrystalline ferrite body includes the
      steps of mixing starting materials which include an .alpha.-Fe.sub.2
      O.sub.3 powder with particles having a thin disc shape and other compounds
      in the weight ratio of given ferrite composition, cold-pressing the
      mixture into a cold-pressed body by a uniaxial pressure and sintering the
      cold-pressed body into a solid body so that the crystallites of the
      sintered body have the (111) 111)-planes substantially oriented.

PAL  An assembly comprised of a flexible, magnetic recording disk and a jacket
      or envelope which houses the disk in a manner such that the disk can
      rotate in the jacket under the influence of a conventional disk drive. The
      jacket has a notch at one corner thereof to provide a write enable
      function for the assembly when used with the disk drive. A rigid member is
      provided adjacent to the notch to close the opening formed thereby between
      the two sides of the jacket and to reinforce the corner to prevent
      structural damage to the jacket when used with the disk drive. The jacket
      is formed from an initially flat sheet of material and, except for the
      aforesaid rigid member, there is no structure between the outer periphery
      of the disk and the adjacent margin of the jacket.

PAL  A flexible disk file signal storage apparatus has a multiplicity of
      relatively thin, flexible disks of varying radii and arranged axially to
      facilitate radial disk selection. The radii pattern tends to minimize
      radii differences, thereby enhancing storage capacity. The flexible disks
      are arranged in axial groups of more than three disks with at least one
      disk in each group having a minimum radius with a pair of outer disks with
      a maximum radius plus at least one intermediate diameter disk. By
      interleaving alternate ones of said minimum radius disks between
      intermediate and maximum radius disks, radial selection access ports are
      maximized along an axial direction for a given radial difference between
      the maximum and minimum disk radii.
